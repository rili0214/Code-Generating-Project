#### 1. **Clang Tidy (Static Analysis)**
- **Results:** No errors or warnings found.
- **Status:** Success.
- **Summary:** The code has passed the static analysis step without any issues, indicating that it adheres to the coding standards and rules covered by Clang Tidy.

#### 2. **Valgrind (Dynamic Memory Analysis)**
- **Results:** No memory issues detected, such as memory leaks, invalid reads/writes, or uninitialized values.
- **Status:** Success.
- **Summary:** The dynamic memory analysis did not uncover any memory-related issues, which is a strong indicator of clean and safe memory usage in the code.

#### 3. **Dafny (Formal Verification)**
- **Results:** No code provided for verification.
- **Summary:** Dafny could not perform any verification because no code was provided to it. This tool can help ensure that the code meets formal specification requirements but was not utilized for this evaluation.

#### 4. **RankMe (Code Quality Metric)**
- **Score:** 2.1753277471610737
- **Summary:** The RankMe score indicates that the code's general quality, measured by aspects such as readability, maintainability, and style, could be improved.

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths:**
  - The code has no static analysis errors, and no memory issues were detected, indicating solidness in code correctness and safety.
  - It follows standard practices and coding guidelines without introducing potential bugs.
  
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Dafny could not be utilized because no formal specifications were provided, which means the code has not been formally verified with respect to its intended behavior.
  - The RankMe score indicates room for improvement regarding code quality metrics.

### Actionable Tips for Improvement
#### Improve Code Quality According to RankMe Metrics
1. **Enhance Readability:**
   - *Tip:* Use more descriptive variable names if applicable. For this code, since `i` and `j` are common loop counters, it's fine, but in more complex loops, consider clearer names.
   
2. **Improve Maintainability:**
   - *Tip:* This code is already simple, but if it grows in complexity, consider adding comments, refactoring into functions, and following a modular structure.
   
3. **Consistent Style:**
   - *Tip:* Ensure consistent formatting across the codebase, such as whitespace and indentation. Use a tool like `clang-format` to automatically format your code.
   
   *Example:* 
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstdio>

   // Function to print multiplication table up to n
   void printMultiplicationTable(int n) {
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
               printf("%dx%d = %d\n", i, j, i * j);
           }
       }
   }

   int main() {
       printMultiplicationTable(10);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### Utilize Formal Verification
1. **Provide Specifications:**
   - *Tip:* Write formal specifications in Dafny or another formal verification tool to specify the intended behavior of the code. This can help catch logical errors and ensure the code behaves as expected.
   
2. **Analyze and Refine:**
   - *Tip:* Use the formal verification tool's results to agree or refine your code, ensuring both correctness and efficiency.

By focusing on these areas, the code can be improved both in terms of quality metrics and ensuring its behavior meets rigorous standards.

### Actionable Tips on How to Improve the Code Quality

Despite the high score, there are always areas of improvement and best practices to adhere to, especially in terms of readability and modern C++ practices:

#### 1. Use `std::iostream` Instead of `std::cout` and `std::cin`
- **Why**: This makes it clear which part of the standard library is being used.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << std::endl;
  ```

#### 2. Avoid Using `using namespace std;`
- **Why**: It avoids namespace pollution, especially in larger projects. If functions from `std` are needed frequently, one could use `using std::cin;`, `using std::cout;`, etc.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  #include<iostream>
  #include<cmath>

  int main()
  {
      int a, b;

      while (std::cin >> a >> b){
          std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << std::endl;
      }

      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Consider Using `std::endl` Prudently
- **Why**: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline but also flushes the stream, which can be costly performance-wise. Use `"\n"` for line breaks if flushing is not necessary.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << "\n";
  ```

#### 4. Handle Edge Cases and Input Validation
- **Why**: Ensures robustness and prevents undefined behavior due to invalid input.
- **Example**: Consider what happens when `a + b` is negative (e.g., undefined behavior if using `log10` directly). Additionally, handle cases where input might not be integers.
- **Example Impl**:
  ```cpp
  #include<iostream>
  #include<cmath>
  #include<limits>       // for numeric_limits

  int main()
  {
      int a, b;

      while (std::cin >> a >> b){
          if (a + b < 0) {
              std::cerr << "Error: The sum of a and b must be non-negative.\n";
              // Optionally handle the error, here we just skip
              std::cin.clear();  // clear the error flag on cin
              std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');  // discard invalid input
              continue;
          }
          std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << "\n";
      }

      return 0;
  }
  ```

### Actionable Tips on How to Improve Code Quality and Performance

1. **Improve Variable Naming:**
   - **Reason:** Descriptive variable names improve code readability and maintainability.
   - **Action:** Rename variables `iN`, `iNum`, `Temp` to more descriptive names.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     int numberOfTests;
     cin >> numberOfTests;

     for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTests; i++) {
         int numbers[3];
         for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
             cin >> numbers[j];
         }

         for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
             for (int k = j + 1; k < 3; k++) {
                 if (numbers[j] > numbers[k]) {
                    int temp = numbers[j];
                    numbers[j] = numbers[k];
                    numbers[k] = temp;
                 }
             }
         }

         if ((numbers[0] * numbers[0]) + (numbers[1] * numbers[1]) == (numbers[2] * numbers[2])) {
             cout << "YES" << endl;
         } else {
             cout << "NO" << endl;
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Use Constants for Array Size:**
   - **Reason:** Defining a constant for the size of the array improves flexibility and readability.
   - **Action:** Define a constant for the array size.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     const int ARRAY_SIZE = 3;
     int numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];
     ```

3. **Use STL for Sorting:**
   - **Reason:** Using the C++ Standard Library (STL) functions improves code efficiency and clarity.
   - **Action:** Replace the sorting logic with `std::sort`.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <algorithm> // For std::sort
     ...
     for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTests; i++) {
         int numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];
         for (int j = 0; j < ARRAY_SIZE; j++) {
             cin >> numbers[j];
         }

         std::sort(numbers, numbers + ARRAY_SIZE);

         if ((numbers[0] * numbers[0]) + (numbers[1] * numbers[1]) == (numbers[2] * numbers[2])) {
             cout << "YES" << endl;
         } else {
             cout << "NO" << endl;
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Avoid Using `using namespace std;`:**
   - **Reason:** This can lead to name conflicts and is considered a bad practice in larger projects.
   - **Action:** Remove `using namespace std;` and prefix standard library calls with `std::`.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     // #include <iostream>
     // using namespace std;
     #include <iostream>

     int main()
     {
         int numberOfTests;
         std::cin >> numberOfTests;

         for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTests; i++) {
             int numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];
             for (int j = 0; j < ARRAY_SIZE; j++) {
                 std::cin >> numbers[j];
             }

             std::sort(numbers, numbers + ARRAY_SIZE);

             if ((numbers[0] * numbers[0]) + (numbers[1] * numbers[1]) == (numbers[2] * numbers[2])) {
                 std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;
             } else {
                 std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
             }
         }

         return 0;
     }
     ```

By following the above improvements, the code will become more readable, maintainable, and flexible, contributing to a higher quality codebase.

2024-12-02 22:15:11,497 - INFO - Final output: ### Analysis of Evaluation Results

#### 1. Clang-Tidy (Static Analysis)
- **Command**: `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_31e1defa-8ba5-4f2d-8534-1ebf7621670f.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **File**: `temp/code_files/temp_code_31e1defa-8ba5-4f2d-8534-1ebf7621670f.cpp`
- **Return Code**: `0`
- **Status**: `success`
- **Errors**: None
- **Warnings**: None

**Summary**: Clang-Tidy did not report any errors or warnings in the code using the provided checks. This indicates that the code adheres to the coding standards and practices checked by Clang-Tidy, which is a good sign for maintaining clean and maintainable code.

#### 2. Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score**: 10
- **Static Analysis**: 10

**Summary**: The final evaluation score is 10, indicating perfect compliance with the checked static analysis rules. No issues were flagged that could affect the overall score.

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**:
- The code passes all static analysis checks by Clang-Tidy.
- The code handles division by zero when calculating the determinant (`denom`), which is crucial for avoiding runtime errors.
- The use of `typedef` and macros for common constructs makes the code more readable and maintainable.

**Weaknesses**:
- Consider avoiding the use of `using namespace std;` to prevent name collisions in larger programs.
- Macros can sometimes lead to less readable and maintainable code due to preprocessor expansion issues. Consider using `const` or `constexpr` variables instead.
- The `fixed` and `setprecision` manipulators always set the precision to 3 decimal places, which may not be optimal for all use cases.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Avoid `using namespace std;`**:
   - **Why**: This can lead to namespace conflicts in larger codebases.
   - **Action**: Replace `using namespace std;` with explicit usage of the `std` namespace.
     ```cpp
     // Include this instead of 'using namespace std;'
     #include <iostream>
     #include <iomanip>

     int main() {
         std::cin.tie(0);
         std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
         std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(3);

         int a, b, c, d, e, f;
         while (std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f) {
             double denom = (double)(b * d - a * e);
             if (denom != 0.0) {
                 double y = (double)(c * d - a * f) / denom;
                 double x = (c - b * y) / a;
                 std::cout << x << " " << y << "\n";
             } else {
                 std::cout << "Parallel lines or no solution\n";
             }
         }

         return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Replace Macros with `const` or `constexpr` Variables**:
   - **Why**: Macros can lead to unexpected behavior due to preprocessor expansion.
   - **Action**: Replace macros like `INF`, constants like `PI`, and placeholders like `FOR`, `REP`, `ALL`, `pb`, `fi`, `se` with appropriate `const` or `constexpr` variables.
     ```cpp
     constexpr double INF = 1e18;
     constexpr double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

     // Replace ALL, FOR, REP, etc. with appropriate loops or functions
     // Example:
     #undef ALL
     #define ALL(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()

     int main() {
         // Use the constants and avoid macros
         double my_pi = PI;
         double infinity = INF;
     }
     ```

3. **Consider Flexible Precision Settings**:
   - **Why**: The current precision setting might not be suitable for all cases.
   - **Action**: Allow the user to specify the precision or set it conditionally based on the problem requirements.
     ```cpp
     // Allow user to input precision or set it with a condition
     int precision = 3;  // This can be an input or derived from some conditions
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(precision);

     // Example: Conditional precision
     if (some_condition) {
         precision = 5;
     }
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(precision);
     ```

By implementing these changes, the code can become more robust, readable, and maintainable, further improving its quality and performance.

- **Status**: Success
- **Return Code**: 0
- **Errors**: None
- **Warnings**: None

### Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score**: 10
- **Static Analysis Score**: 10

## 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

### Strengths
- **No Errors or Warnings**: The Clang-Tidy analysis did not identify any issues, indicating that the code adheres to best practices and does not have syntax errors or common programming pitfalls.
- **Perfect Scores**: Both the final score and the static analysis score are 10, reflecting high quality and correctness.

### Potential Areas for Improvement
- **Use of `using namespace std;`**: While this doesn't cause an error, it can lead to name conflicts and is considered bad practice in larger projects.
- **Code Clarity and Readability**: Although the code is correct, it can be improved for better readability and maintainability.

## 3. Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Score

### Specific Suggestions

#### 1. Avoid Using `using namespace std;`
- **Issue**: Using `using namespace std;` can cause name conflicts when including multiple libraries, as it introduces every name in the `std` namespace into the global namespace.
- **Solution**: Replace `using namespace std;` with explicit `std::` namespace qualifications.

  **Example**:
  ```cpp
  // Before
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
      cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // Relies on 'using namespace std;'
  }

  // After
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
      std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // Explicitly uses 'std::'
  }
  ```

#### 2. Add Comments and Documentation
- **Issue**: The code is concise but lacks comments or documentation, which can make it harder for others (or yourself) to understand the code in the future.
- **Solution**: Add comments to explain the purpose, usage, and logic of the code.

  **Example**:
  ```cpp
  // Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
  unsigned int comp_GCD(unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
      while (b != 0) {
          unsigned int r = a % b;
          a = b;
          b = r;
      }
      return a;
  }

  int main() {
      unsigned int a, b;
      vector<unsigned int> result_gcd;
      vector<unsigned int> result_lcm;

      // Read pairs of numbers from input until EOF.
      while (cin >> a >> b) {
          unsigned int gcd = comp_GCD(a, b);
          result_gcd.push_back(gcd);
          result_lcm.push_back(a * b / gcd); // Calculate LCM using the relation LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b)
      }

      // Output the results.
      for (unsigned int i = 0; i < result_gcd.size(); i++) {
          cout << result_gcd[i] << " " << result_lcm[i] << endl;
      }
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Consider Robustness and Edge Cases
- **Issue**: While the code handles typical cases, it does not handle possible edge cases such as division by zero or overflow.
- **Solution**: Add checks and handle edge cases appropriately.

  **Example**:
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <vector>
  #include <limits> // For std::numeric_limits

  using namespace std;

  unsigned int comp_GCD(unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
      while (b != 0) {
          unsigned int r = a % b;
          a = b;
          b = r;
      }
      return a;
  }

  int main() {
      unsigned int a, b;
      vector<unsigned int> result_gcd;
      vector<unsigned int> result_lcm;

      while (cin >> a >> b) {
          // Handle edge case where both a and b are zero
          if (a == 0 && b == 0) {
              cerr << "Error: GCD and LCM are undefined for both numbers being zero." << endl;
              continue;
          }

          // Handle potential overflow
          if (a > std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max() / b) {
              cerr << "Error: Multiplication would cause overflow." << endl;
              continue;
          }

          unsigned int gcd = comp_GCD(a, b);
          result_gcd.push_back(gcd);
          result_lcm.push_back(a * b / gcd);
      }

      // Output the results.
      for (unsigned int i = 0; i < result_gcd.size(); i++) {
          cout << result_gcd[i] << " " << result_lcm[i] << endl;
      }
      return 0;
  }
  ```

By implementing these changes, you can enhance the robustness, readability, and maintainability of the code while preserving its correctness and performance.

2024-12-02 22:45:54,448 - INFO - Final output: ### 1. Summary of Analysis Results for Each Included Tool

#### Clang-Tidy:
- **Command:** `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_6de23a06-bcfc-40a1-a0c3-76b8dc62c1d4.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **File:** `temp/code_files/temp_code_6de23a06-bcfc-40a1-a0c3-76b8dc62c1d4.cpp`
- **Status:** `failure`
- **Return Code:** `1`
- **Errors:** [] 
- **Warnings:** []

**Observations:**
Clang-Tidy was invoked with all checks except for specific clang diagnostic warnings, treating warnings as errors. Despite running the analysis, the status shown is `failure` with a return code of `1` indicating that Clang-Tidy encountered issues during the analysis, but the exact errors are not listed. 

### 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

#### Key Issues:
- **Suspicious Status:** The analysis status is `failure`, which seems unexpected given that there are no errors or warnings explicitly listed. This indicates a potential issue with the command setup or the environment in which Clang-Tidy was run.
- **Use of `using namespace std;`:** This is considered bad practice as it can lead to name collisions and decreases code clarity.

#### Key Strengths:
- The generated code is simple and performs the intended functionality of reversing a string input by the user.
- No reported errors or warnings by Clang-Tidy (though it failed to execute successfully), indicating that the code does not have any serious syntactical or logical errors (unless the failure is due to other issues not captured in the output).

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

#### Fixing the Clang-Tidy Failure:
1. **Verify the Clang-Tidy Installation:** Ensure that Clang-Tidy is correctly installed and that the correct path is used.
2. **Check the File Path:** Confirm that the file path provided to Clang-Tidy is correct and that the file is accessible.
3. **Check for Environment Issues:** Sometimes, environment-specific issues could cause Clang-Tidy to fail. Make sure there are no upcoming IO or permission issues with the file.
4. **Review the Command Parameters:** Examine if the parameters passed to Clang-Tidy are correct and suitable for the task. `-Werror` flags warnings as errors, which may be undesirable; consider removing it if warnings are being treated as problematic failures.
   
#### Improve the Code Quality:
1. **Avoid `using namespace std;`:** Instead of using `using namespace std;`, explicitly qualify the standard library names to avoid namespace pollution and potential name clashes with other libraries.
   ```cpp
   // before
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>
   
   using namespace std;
   
   int main() {
       string s;
       cin >> s;
       reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
       cout << s << endl;
       return 0;
   }

   // after
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   int main() {
       std::string s;
       std::cin >> s;
       std::reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
       std::cout << s << std::endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   
2. **Consider Input Validation:** While the simple code shown will work for valid inputs, adding input validation can make the code more robust and user-friendly.
   ```cpp
   // after input validation
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   int main() {
       std::string s;

       if (std::getline(std::cin, s)) { // read a line of input
           std::reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
           std::cout << s << std::endl;
       } else {
           std::cerr << "Error reading input." << std::endl;
           return 1;
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```
   
3. **Consistent Return Codes:** Ensure that your code has explicit and consistent return codes for different conditions, as illustrated in the improved example above.
   
4. **Error Handling for Reverse Function:** Although `std::reverse` does not throw exceptions and will work as expected for strings, for broader error management, consider checking the state of the input or handling potential exceptions (if using other STL algorithms).

By addressing both the Clang-Tidy setup issues and refactoring the code to improve maintainability and robustness, the code's quality and confidence in its correctness can be significantly enhanced.

1. **Clang-Tidy (Static Analysis)**
   - **Command**: `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_eac8eed0-4edc-4f00-85a8-71fef7e983e7.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
   - **Status**: `success`
   - **Return Code**: `0`
   - **Errors and Warnings**: None identified
   - **Summary**: The code passed the Clang-Tidy static analysis with no errors or warnings, indicating that it adheres to coding standards and best practices enforced by this tool.

2. **Final Evaluation Score**
   - **Static Analysis Score**: `10`
   - **Final Score**: `10`
   - **Summary**: The code received a perfect score for static analysis, which reflects high quality in terms of adherence to standards and absence of any identified issues.

### Key Strengths

- No compile-time or logical errors were identified.
- The code structure is straightforward and easy to understand.

### Key Weaknesses
- **None Identified**: Given the perfect score, there are no critical issues or weaknesses that the analysed tools detected.

### Actionable Tips

1. **Improve Readability and Maintainability**
   - **Use Meaningful Variable Names**: Enhance the readability by using more descriptive variable names than generic ones like `base` and `n`.
     - **Example**: Rename `base` to `principal` and `n` to `years`, assuming this is a financial calculation-related snippet.
   - **Add Comments**: Comment to describe the purpose of the operations and any complex logic.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       // Increase the principal by 5% per year
       base = static_cast<long long>(1.05 * base);
       
       // Adjust to the nearest thousand
       if (base % 1000 != 0) {
           base = (base / 1000) * 1000 + 1000;
       } else {
           base = (base / 1000) * 1000;
       }
       ```

2. **Code Optimization**
   - **Avoid Redundant Calculations**: If `base` is consistently divisible by 1000 before the conditional check, the else clause can be removed:
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       base = static_cast<long long>(1.05 * base);
       base = ((base + 999) / 1000) * 1000; // Rounds up to the nearest thousand in one step
       ```

3. **Consider Range and Overflow**
   - **Check for Valid Input Values**: Ensure that the user input (`n`) is within an acceptable range to prevent overflow or unintended behavior, especially given that `base` is of type `long long`.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       if (n < 0 || n > 10000) { // Example range check
           std::cerr << "Invalid number of years." << std::endl;
           return 1;
       }
       ```

4. **Enhance User Interaction**
   - **Provide User Feedback**: Before reading `n`, prompt the user to enter the required value.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       std::cout << "Enter the number of years: ";
       std::cin >> n;
       ```

By implementing these suggestions, the code will not only maintain its current high quality but will also improve in terms of readability, maintainability, and robustness.

- **Status:** `success`
- **Errors:** None detected
- **Warnings:** None detected

#### Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score:** `10`
- **Static Analysis Score:** `10`

### Key Issues & Strengths

**Strengths:**
- The code successfully passes all checks from Clang-Tidy without any errors or warnings, indicating it adheres to best coding practices and does not have easily detectable issues.
- The final score of `10` suggests the code performs adequately based on the static analysis.

**Key Issues:**
- Despite the passing grade, there are logical areas where improvements can be made for code efficiency and readability.

### Actionable Tips for Improvement

1. **Variable Naming Conventions:**
   - Strengthen the naming conventions for variables to make it easier to understand the purpose of each variable.
     - **Original Code:**
       ```cpp
       int n, i, a, b, c, d, ans = 0;
       ```
     - **Improved Code:**
       ```cpp
       int input_number, iteration_count, digit1, digit2, digit3, digit4, valid_count = 0;
       ```
   
2. **Logical Issues:**
   - The condition inside the `if` statement contains a typo (`&&&` instead of `&&`). Although this error was not picked up by Clang-Tidy, it could lead to issues if such a typo were present in the actual code.
     - **Original Code:**
       ```cpp
       if(n > 0 &&& n <= 36)  // Use && instead of &&&
       ```
     - **Improved Code:**
       ```cpp
       if(n > 0 && n <= 36)
       ```
   - The logical `else if` containing the break condition could be refactored to simplify the control flow.
     - **Original Code:**
       ```cpp
       else if(n <= 0 || n > 50)
       {
         break;
       }
       ```
     - **Improved Code (Consider using an early exit):**
       ```cpp
       if (n <= 0 || n > 50) {
         break;
       }
       ```

3. **Code Efficiency:**
   - The nested loops used to calculate the sum of digits are straightforward but could be improved to reduce the number of iterations. For example, by limiting the ranges of `digit1`, `digit2`, `digit3`, and `digit4` based on the remaining sum, we could significantly reduce the number of iterations.
     - **Optimization Example:**
       The current implementation tests up to 10,000 combinations (10x10x10x10) for each number. We can reduce this by adjusting the ranges of subsequent loops based on the sum requirements.
       ```cpp
       for(a = 0; a <= 9 && n >= a; a++) {
           for(b = 0; b <= 9 && n - a >= b; b++) {
               for(c = 0; c <= 9 && n - a - b >= c; c++) {
                   digit4 = n - a - b - c;
                   if (digit4 >= 0 && digit4 <= 9) {
                       valid_count++;
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       ```

4. **Code Readability:**
   - Adding comments and blank lines can help separate logical sections of the code, making it easier to understand.
     - **Improved Version with Comments:**
       ```cpp
       /*************************************
        * Main Function
        * Description:
        *   This function reads integers from the user and calculates the number
        *   of 4-digit combinations where the sum of the digits equals the input number.
        *************************************/
       int main(void)
       {
         int input_number, iteration_count = 0, digit1, digit2, digit3, digit4, valid_count = 0;

         while(iteration_count < 50)
         {
           scanf("%d", &input_number);

           valid_count = 0;

           // Validate input number
           if(input_number > 0 && input_number <= 36)
           {
             // Iterate over all possible 4-digit combinations
             for(digit1 = 0; digit1 <= 9 && input_number - digit1 >= 0; digit1++)
             {
               for(digit2 = 0; digit2 <= 9 && input_number - digit1 - digit2 >= 0; digit2++)
               {
                 for(digit3 = 0; digit3 <= 9 && input_number - digit1 - digit2 - digit3 >= 0; digit3++)
                 {
                   digit4 = input_number - digit1 - digit2 - digit3;
                   if (digit4 >= 0 && digit4 <= 9) {
                     valid_count++;
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
           else {
             break;
           }

           printf("%d\n", valid_count);
           iteration_count++;
         }
         return 0;
       }
       ```

By implementing these improvements, the code becomes more readable, efficient, and robust, thus enhancing overall quality and performance.

2024-12-02 23:09:01,149 - INFO - Final output: ### 1. Summary of Analysis Results for Each Included Tool

#### Clang-Tidy
- **Command:** `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_a9c7db3f-5a00-41cb-b5a2-c119c36f7d88.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **Status:** Success
- **Errors and Warnings:** None

### 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths
#### Clang-Tidy
- **Strength:** Clang-Tidy did not detect any errors or warnings, indicating that the code aligns with C++ best practices and adheres to common coding standards.

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

#### General Improvements:
- **Code Readability:** Improve the readability of the code by adding comments and meaningful variable names where applicable.
- **Memory Usage:** Ensure that the memory usage is optimized, especially since global variables `dp` and `isprime` are declared outside of `main()`. For very large values of `N` (e.g., 1,000,001 integers), verify that memory consumption is within acceptable limits.

#### Code-Specific Suggestions:
- **Variable Names:** Use more descriptive variable names, especially `dp` and `isprime`.
- **Comments:** Add comments to explain the logic of your algorithm, especially the segment where the sieve of Eratosthenes is applied.
- **Input Validation:** While the input validation in the `while` loop seems correct, consider adding validation for edge cases such as negative numbers or zero if they are not expected.
- **Constants Naming:** Use `const` variables with uppercase letters for constants like `N` (`MAX_FRAME` could be a better name).

#### Example Improvements:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

const int MAX_FRAMES = 1000009;
int primeCountUpTo[MAX_FRAMES];
int isNotPrime[MAX_FRAMES];

int main() {
    // Sieve of Eratosthenes
    memset(isNotPrime, 0, sizeof(isNotPrime));
    primeCountUpTo[1] = 0;

    for(int i = 2; i < MAX_FRAMES; i++) {
        if(!isNotPrime[i]) {
            for(int j = 2 * i; j < MAX_FRAMES; j += i) {
                isNotPrime[j] = 1;
            }
            primeCountUpTo[i] = primeCountUpTo[i - 1] + 1;
        } else {
            primeCountUpTo[i] = primeCountUpTo[i - 1];
        }
    }

    int query;
    // Process each query until EOF or zero is encountered
    while(scanf("%d", &query) != EOF && query > 0) {
        printf("%d\n", primeCountUpTo[query]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Score

#### 1. Add Comments
**Why:** Comments are essential for code maintenance and readability. They help other developers (or your future self) understand the purpose and flow of the code more easily.

**How:** Add comments at the function level and critical sections of code.
**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    // Read the size of the vector from input
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    std::vector<int> v(w);

    // Initialize the vector with values from 1 to w
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        v[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Read the number of swap operations
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    // Perform the specified number of swaps
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        int a, b;
        char c; // This variable is likely a placeholder for the operation (e.g., '=', but not used here)
        std::cin >> a >> c >> b;
        std::swap(v[a - 1], v[b - 1]);
    }

    // Output the final state of the vector
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        std::cout << v[i] << (i < w - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. Add Input Validation
**Why:** It's crucial to validate user inputs to prevent undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.

**How:** Check that the input values are within expected ranges.
**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    if (w <= 0) { // Ensure w is a positive integer
        std::cerr << "Invalid size for vector.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    std::vector<int> v(w);
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        v[i] = i + 1;
    }

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n < 0) { // Ensure n is non-negative
        std::cerr << "Invalid number of operations.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        int a, b;
        char c;
        std::cin >> a >> c >> b;
        if (a <= 0 || b <= 0 || a > w || b > w) { // Ensure a and b are within valid range
            std::cerr << "Invalid indices for swap operation.\n";
            return 1;
        }
        std::swap(v[a - 1], v[b - 1]);
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        std::cout << v[i] << (i < w - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Use Range-Based Loops for Traversal
**Why:** Range-based for loops can make the code cleaner and are less prone to errors (like off-by-one errors).

**How:** Replace traditional loops with range-based loops where applicable.
**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    if (w <= 0) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid size for vector.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    std::vector<int> v(w);
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        v[i] = i + 1;
    }

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n < 0) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid number of operations.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        int a, b;
        char c;
        std::cin >> a >> c >> b;
        if (a <= 0 || b <= 0 || a > w || b > w) {
            std::cerr << "Invalid indices for swap operation.\n";
            return 1;
        }
        std::swap(v[a - 1], v[b - 1]);
    }

    for (int value : v) { // Use a range-based for loop for output
        std::cout << value << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Final Thoughts
Your code is in good shape, with no apparent issues from a static analysis perspective. Enhancing it with comments, input validation, and range-based loops will make it more robust and easier to maintain.

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

- **Line Too Long**: (Pylint issue - line-too-long)
  - **Problem**: The line exceeds the allowed character length.
  - **Solution**: Split the long line into multiple lines or adjust the code for brevity.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    tri = list(map(int, input().split()))
    tri.sort()
    if tri[0]**2 + tri[1]**2 == tri[2]**2:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
    ```

- **Missing Final Newline**: (Pylint issue - missing-final-newline)
  - **Problem**: The file does not end with a newline.
  - **Solution**: Simply add a newline at the end of the file.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    # End of file (extra newline here)
    ```

- **Module Name does not conform to snake_case**: (Pylint issue - invalid-name)
  - **Problem**: The filename does not follow the snake_case naming convention, which is the recommended style for Python modules.
  - **Solution**: Rename the file to conform to snake_case, such as `right_angle_detector.py`.
  - **Example**: `temp_code_9cb3bc21-599f-4191-876e-14bc47f8340c.py` → `right_angle_detector.py`

  """
  This module contains a main function that reads pairs of integers from the input,
  calculates their GCD and LCM, and prints the results. It handles invalid input gracefully
  and exits on EOF.
  """
  ```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Issue**: The module name does not conform to the PEP 8 naming convention (snake_case).
- **Action**: Rename the module to follow the snake_case naming convention.
- **Example**: `gcd_lcm_calculator.py`

#### Final Newline
- **Issue**: Missing final newline.
- **Action**: Add an extra newline at the end of the file.
- **Example**: Ensure the file ends with a blank line.
  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()

  ```

By addressing these minor stylistic and documentation issues, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code while adhering to PEP 8 guidelines. This will make it easier for others to understand and contribute to your code in the future.

     ```python
     """
     This module provides a function to calculate the final amount after a specified number of years.
     """
     ```
   - **Naming Convention**: Rename the module to a proper snake_case naming.
     - Example: If this was a file, rename it to `calculate_amount.py`.
   - **Variable Redefinition**: Avoid using the same name 'n' for both the input variable and the function's parameter.
     ```python
     num_years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))
     print(calculate_final_amount(num_years))
     ```
   - **Import Order**: Place all imports at the top of the module.
     ```python
     import math

     def calculate_final_amount(n):
         ...
     ```

2. **Enhance Code Readability**:
   - Improving naming conventions and readability will aid in overall understanding and maintenance.
   - Use additional comments and docstrings to explain complex logic, especially if it is not self-explanatory.

3. **Finalized Code Example**:
   ```python
   """
   This module provides a function to calculate the final amount after a specified number of years.
   """

   import math

   def calculate_final_amount(n):
       """
       Calculate the final amount after n years with an annual increase of 5%
       and rounding up each year.

       :param n: Number of years
       :return: Final amount multiplied by 1000
       """
       m = 100.0
       for _ in range(n):
           m = math.ceil(m * 1.05)
       return int(m * 1000)


   if __name__ == "__main__":
       num_years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))
       print(calculate_final_amount(num_years))
   ```

By addressing the identified issues and following these tips, the code's quality and maintainability can be significantly improved.

2024-12-03 00:14:19,162 - INFO - Final output: ### Summary of Evaluation Results

#### 1. **Static Analysis Tool Results:**
   - **Tool: mypy**
     - **Result:** Success: No issues found in 1 source file.
     - **Highlights:** The code adheres to type annotations correctly, and mypy did not find any type-related issues.
  
   - **Tool: pylint**
     - **Result:** Code rated at 5.45/10. Multiple issues identified.
     - **Specific Issues Identified:**
       - **Missing Final Newline (missing-final-newline):** Last line of the code file should contain a newline character.
       - **Missing Module Docstring (missing-module-docstring):** The module `temp_code_44097cff-d969-40ed-9e08-a3fea57a8b7d` is missing a docstring.
       - **Invalid Name for Module (invalid-name):** The module name does not follow the snake_case naming style.
       - **Redefining Variable (redefined-outer-name):** The variable `n` is redefined from the outer scope, which may cause confusion.
       - **Unnecessary `elif` After `return` (no-else-return):** The `elif` statement is unnecessary because the `return` in the `if` block terminates the function.

   - **Tool: bandit**
     - **Result:** No issues identified.
     - **Highlights:** Bandit, which checks for security issues in Python code, found no potential security problems in the code.

#### 2. **Key Strengths & Weaknesses**
   - **Strengths:**
     - **Type Safety:** The code does not trigger any issues related to type safety, meaning it uses Python’s type hinting effectively.
     - **Security:** Bandit did not find any security concerns with the code, indicating there are no obvious vulnerabilities.
     - **Readability for Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci function is well-documented with a clear docstring.
   
   - **Weaknesses:**
     - **Pylint Issues:** The code has several issues that affect Pylint's rating:
       - Missing docstrings for the module-level (module docstring).
       - Naming convention violations.
       - Potential confusion from redefined variable names.
       - Unnecessary `elif` statements.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Address Pylint Issues:**
   - **Add a Module Docstring:** Include a summary of the module's functionality at the top of the file, before any classes and functions.
     ```python
     """
     This module provides functions to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
     """
     ```
   - **Module Naming Convention:** Rename the module file to follow the snake_case naming style. For example, `fibonacci_calculator.py`.
   - **Avoid Redefining Outer Variables:** Refrain from reusing variable names like `n` within the scope of the function to prevent confusion.
     ```python
     # Read input from the user
     input_n = int(input())
     print(fibonacci(input_n))
     ```
   - **Remove Unnecessary `elif`:** Simplify the conditional structure by removing the `elif` when the `return` in the `if` block ensures no further execution is needed.
     ```python
     def fibonacci(n):
         """
         Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach to optimize space complexity.
         """
         if n <= 0:
             return 0
         if n == 1:
             return 1

         pair = [1, 1]
         for i in range(2, n + 1):
             pair[i % 2] = sum(pair)

         return pair[n % 2]
     ```
   - **Final Newline:** Ensure that the last line of the file is an empty newline by pressing Enter at the end of the last line in your text editor.

2. **Code Organization and Standards:**
   - **Docstrings for Functions:** Always include docstrings for each function to describe its purpose, parameters, and output.
   - **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8) style guide for writing clean and consistent code.
     - Use consistent indentation (4 spaces per indentation level).
     - Ensure there are two blank lines between top-level functions and class definitions.
     - Use spaces around operators and after commas.
     - Keep line length to a maximum of 79 characters.

By addressing these issues, the code will not only improve its quality according to standard Python coding conventions but ensure it is more maintainable and robust.

- **Security**: No security issues detected by bandit, suggesting that the code is safe from common vulnerabilities.

#### **Weaknesses**
- **Lack of Documentation**: Both module and function docstrings are absent, which hinders understanding and maintenance.
- **Code Style and Naming**: The module name and variable `C` violate PEP 8 naming conventions.
- **Type Checking**: Functions are untyped by default, which reduces safety and catch errors at compile time.

### Actionable Tips for Improvement

1. **Add Docstrings**:
   - **Module Docstring**: Provide a high-level summary of what the module does.
   - **Function Docstring**: Explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of the `main` function.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     """
     This module processes input data representing a graph and computes discovery and finishing times using Depth-First Search (DFS).
     """
     
     def main():
         """
         Reads input graph data, performs DFS to compute discovery and finishing times, and prints these times for each node.
         """
     ```

2. **Improve Naming Conventions**:
   - **Module Name**: Rename the module to a snake_case name, such as `graph_dfs.py`.
   - **Variable Naming**: Rename `C` to a more descriptive name like `adjacency_list`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def main():
         adjacency_list: List[deque[int]] = [deque() for _ in range(n + 1)]
     ```

3. **Enable Type Checking for All Functions**:
   - **Use --check-untyped-defs**: Run mypy with the `--check-untyped-defs` option to check the bodies of untyped functions.
   - **Add Type Annotations**: Explicitly define types for function arguments and return values.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from collections import deque
     from typing import List

     def main() -> None:
         q: deque[int] = deque()

         n: int = int(input())
         adjacency_list: List[deque[int]] = [deque() for _ in range(n + 1)]

         for _ in range(n):
             tmp: List[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
             for j in range(1, tmp[0]):
                 adjacency_list[tmp[0]].append(tmp[j])

         visited: List[bool] = [False] * (n + 1)
         discovery_times: List[int] = [0] * (n + 1)
         finishing_times: List[int] = [0] * (n + 1)
         timestamp: int = 0

         def dfs(node: int) -> None:
             nonlocal timestamp
             q.append(node)
             while q:
                 node = q[-1]
                 if discovery_times[node] == 0:
                     timestamp += 1
                     discovery_times[node] = timestamp
                 visited[node] = True
                 found_unvisited: bool = False
                 while adjacency_list[node]:
                     neighbor: int = adjacency_list[node].popleft()
                     if not visited[neighbor]:
                         q.append(neighbor)
                         found_unvisited = True
                         break
                 if not found_unvisited:
                     timestamp += 1
                     finishing_times[q.pop()] = timestamp

         for i in range(1, n + 1):
             if not visited[i]:
                 dfs(i)

         for i in range(1, n + 1):
             print(f"{i} {discovery_times[i]} {finishing_times[i]}")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     ```

4. **Add a Final Newline**:
   - **Method**: Ensure there is a newline at the end of the Python file.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     \n  # <newline character>
     ```

By addressing these issues, you can boost code quality and maintainability, making it easier to read, understand, and extend in the future.

2024-12-03 00:20:38,204 - INFO - Final output: Based on the provided JSON evaluation results, let's break down the analysis results for each tool and provide actionable tips to improve the code quality.

### 1. Summary of Analysis Results for Each Tool

**1.1. Mypy (Static Analysis)**
- **Results**: Success: no issues found in 1 source file.
- **Summary**: No type-related errors have been detected. The code appears to be type-safe if type hints are correctly inferred or explicitly defined.

**1.2. Pylint (Code Quality)**
- **Results**: Some coding style and naming convention issues present.
- **Summary**: The issues identified include:
  - Missing final newline at the end of the file.
  - Missing module-level documentation.
  - Invalid module name due to lack of adherence to snake_case.
  - Unused variable 'N' in the `main` function.
  - Improper naming conventions for variable names and function arguments.

**1.3. Bandit (Security Analysis)**
- **Results**: No issues identified.
- **Summary**: The code does not contain any security vulnerabilities related to Bandit's detection criteria.

### 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

**Strengths:**
- The code is type-safe according to mypy.
- No security vulnerabilities detected by Bandit.

**Weaknesses:**
- Non-compliance with style guidelines and naming conventions.
- Presence of an unused variable.

### 3. Actionable Tips to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

**3.1. Address Style and Naming Conventions:**
- **Add a module-level docstring**: Provide a brief description of the module to improve documentation.
  ```python
  """
  This module contains a simple implementation of the insertion sort algorithm
  in Python.
  """
  ```
- **Rename variables to comply with snake_case**: Variable names and function arguments should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores.
  ```python
  def insertion_sort(array):
      length = len(array)
      for i in range(1, length):
          value = array[i]
          j = i - 1
          while j >= 0 and array[j] > value:
              array[j + 1] = array[j]
              j -= 1
          array[j + 1] = value
  ```
- **Use better function and variable names**: Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the function or variable.
  ```python
  def sort_array_by_insertion(arr):
      list_length = len(arr)
      for idx in range(1, list_length):
          current_value = arr[idx]
          # ...
  ```

**3.2. Remove Unused Code:**
- **Remove the unused variable `N`**: The variable `N` in the `main` function is redundant because the length of `A` is not used.
  ```python
  def main():
      """
      Main function to read input and perform insertion sort.
      """
      num_elements = int(input())
      array = list(map(int, input().split()))
      # Remove the print below if it's not needed for testing
      print(' '.join(map(str, array)))
      sort_array_by_insertion(array)
  ```

**3.3. Ensure Readability and Maintainability:**
- **Add trailing newline**: Ensure the file ends with a newline character, as recommended by linting tools.
  ```python
  # Existing code stays the same, but ensure the file ends with a newline when saved.
  ```

**4. Additional Suggestions:**
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding basic error handling to manage invalid inputs.
- **Code Optimization**: Although insertion sort is not the most efficient for large datasets, ensure that the code performs well for expected inputs.
- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure the sorting function behaves as expected under various scenarios.

By addressing these style, naming, and optimization suggestions, the code will not only meet typical coding standards but also become more readable, maintainable, and robust.

2024-12-03 00:23:06,715 - INFO - Final output: ## Evaluation Summary

### 1. **Static Analysis Tool Results**

#### **Tool: mypy**
- **Score: Not Provided Explicitly**
- **Summary:** No issues were found in the code using mypy, a static type checker for Python. This indicates that the code is type-consistent according to the information provided, but no explicit score is given.

#### **Tool: pylint**
- **Score: 5.00/10**
- **Summary:** 
  - **Issues:**
    - Final newline is missing at the end of the file (missing-final-newline).
    - Module name does not conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name).
    - Redefinition of 'x' and 'y' from the outer scope (redefined-outer-name).

#### **Tool: bandit**
- **Score: Not Provided Explicitly**
- **Summary:** Bandit, a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code, found no issues in the provided code. Similar to mypy, no explicit score is provided.

### 2. **Highlights of Key Strengths and Weaknesses**

#### **Strengths:**
- **No Security Issues Detected by Bandit**: The code does not have any notable security flaws, based on bandit’s analysis.
- **Passes Mypy Type Checking**: Indicates type consistency in the code.

#### **Weaknesses:**
- **Low Pylint Score (5.00/10)**: Points out formatting issues, naming conventions, and potential confusion with variable redefinition.
- **Missing Final Newline**: Non-conformance with PEP8 style guidelines, which recommends that files end with a newline character.
- **Module Naming Conventions**: The automatically generated module name does not follow snake_case style conventions, as recommended by PEP8.
- **Confusing Variable Redefinitions**: Redefining 'x' and 'y' in the `gcd` function does not cause any bugs but may confuse readers (given the reuse of parameter names).

### 3. **Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality**

#### **Fixing Code Formatting and Naming Issues**

- **Add a Final Newline**: Ensure each file ends with a newline character to comply with PEP8.
  - **Example Fix:**
    ```python
    print(gcd(x, y))\n  # Note the additional newline after this line in your text editor.
    ```

- **Module Renaming**: Rename the file to a snake_case style name, such as `gcd_calculator.py`.
  - **Example Fix:**
    - File name: `gcd_calculator.py`
    - Rename file as: `gcđ_calculator.py`

- **Avoid Redefining Function Parameters** (to improve code readability):
  - **Example Fix:**
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b  # Use 'a' and 'b' instead of 'x' and 'y'
        return a

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        print(gcd(x, y))
    ```

- **Improve Input Validation and Error Handling**: Adding checks and error handling ensures robustness.
  - **Example Fix:**
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        try:
            x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            if len([x, y]) != 2:
                raise ValueError("Exactly two integers should be provided.")
            print(gcd(x, y))
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Input Error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    ```

#### **Final Thoughts**

While the initial evaluation results show a good final score, there are specific areas that need improvement to adhere to best practices in Python development. By addressing the formatting, naming, and potential confusion from redefined variables, you can enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code. Further, adding input validation contributes to making the code more robust and user-friendly.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary

- **Final Score**: 8.823333333333332
- **Strengths**:
  - The code passes `mypy` with no type issues.
  - `bandit` did not find any security concerns.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - `pylint` flagged several issues related to coding standards and style, which could improve code readability and maintainability.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Add Missing Docstrings**
   - **Why**: Providing documentation helps others (and future you) understand the purpose and usage of modules and functions.
   - **Action**: Use docstrings to describe what each function does, its input parameters, and its return value.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def is_prime(num):
         """Check if a number is prime.
         
         Args:
             num (int): The number to check.
         
         Returns:
             bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
         """
     ```

2. **Use Meaningful Names for Modules**
   - **Why**: A consistent naming convention makes the code more readable and easier to manage.
   - **Action**: Rename the module to conform to snake_case (e.g., `prime_counter.py`).
   - **Example**: `prime_counter.py`

3. **Prevent Variable Shadows**
   - **Why**: Redefining variables from outer scopes can lead to confusion and bugs.
   - **Action**: Avoid reusing variable names from outer contexts.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     n = int(input())  # Remove from count_primes
     def count_primes(count):
         cnt = 0
         for _ in range(count):
             num = int(input())
             if is_prime(num):
                 cnt += 1
         return cnt
     ```

4. **Handle Missing Final Newline**
   - **Why**: Following this style guideline ensures the file adheres to standard conventions.
   - **Action**: Add a newline at the end of the file.
   - **Example**: Ensure the last line is followed by a blank line.

5. **Input Handling**
   - **Why**: Input validation prevents runtime errors and makes the code more robust.
   - **Action**: Validate and sanitize inputs to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def count_primes(n):
         cnt = 0
         for _ in range(n):
             try:
                 num = int(input())
                 if is_prime(num):
                     cnt += 1
             except ValueError:
                 print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")
         return cnt
     ```

By addressing the above points, the code will not only improve in style and readability but also add robustness and maintainability.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary

**Final Score:** 7.62

**Key Strengths:**
- The code is logically correct and passes static, type, and security checks.
- The algorithm used to find the maximum difference is efficient.

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Code does not fully comply with Python style guidelines (PEP 8).
- Variable shadowing (redefining 'n' and 'r') can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Adhere to PEP 8 Style Guidelines:**
   - **Line Length:** Ensure that lines do not exceed 100 characters for better readability.
     ```python
     if n == 0:  # This line is within the 100 character limit.
         return 0
     ```
   - **Trailing Whitespace:** Remove any whitespace at the end of lines. Most modern editors can automatically trim these.
     ```python
     # Before:
     #    min_val = min(min_val, j)   
     #
     # After:
     min_val = min(min_val, j)
     ```
   - **Final Newline:** Add a newline at the end of the file. Most text editors can be configured to automatically add this.
     ```python
     # After last line:
     print(find_max_difference(n, r))
     
     ```
2. **Improve Commenting and Documentation:**
   - **Module Docstring:** Add a module-level docstring to describe the functionality provided by the file.
     ```python
     """
     This module contains a function to find the maximum difference
     between any two elements in the list where the larger element
     comes after the smaller element.
     """
     ```
3. **Refactor Naming:**
   - **Avoid Variable Shadowing:** Use more descriptive, unique names for variables to avoid shadows from outer scopes.
     ```python
     # Before:
     # n = int(input())
     # r = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
     #
     # After:
     num_elements = int(input())
     element_list = [int(input()) for _ in range(num_elements)]
     
     print(find_max_difference(num_elements, element_list))
     ```
4. **Consistent Naming Conventions:**
   - Ensure all identifiers, including the module name, follow snake_case.
     ```python
     # Rename the module to something more descriptive, e.g., `max_difference_finder.py`
     ```

### Final Code Example with Improvements

```python
"""
This module contains a function to find the maximum difference
between any two elements in the list where the larger element
comes after the smaller element.
"""

def find_max_difference(num_elements, elements):
    """
    Find the maximum difference between any two elements in the list 
    where the larger element comes after the smaller element.

    Parameters:
    num_elements (int): The number of elements in the list.
    elements (list): The list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The maximum difference found.
    """
    if num_elements == 0:
        return 0
    
    min_val = elements[0]
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    
    for j in elements[1:]:
        max_diff = max(max_diff, j - min_val)
        min_val = min(min_val, j)
    
    if max_diff == float('-inf'):
        return 0
    
    return max_diff

# Input handling
num_elements = int(input())
elements = [int(input()) for _ in range(num_elements)]

# Output the result
print(find_max_difference(num_elements, elements))
```

By applying these improvements, the code will become more reliable, readable, and maintainable.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score**: 9.02
- **Key Strengths**:
  - The code is type-safe and logically functional, as verified by Mypy.
  - No critical security issues were detected by Bandit.
- **Key Weaknesses**:
  - The code has stylistic and formatting issues that could be improved to meet best practices (as flagged by Pylint).
  - The main function variable 'q' is unused and can be removed, which might indicate a logical issue if it was meant to be used.

### Actionable Tips on How to Improve the Code

1. **Address Pylint Issues**:
   - **Line Length Issues**:
     - **Description**: Line 22 is too long (102 characters when the limit is 100).
     - **Action**: Break down the line to comply with the line length limit.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())  # Original
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(  # Improved
           sort1.copy()  # Improved
       )  # Improved
       ```
   - **Missing Final Newline**:
     - **Description**: The file should end with a newline character.
     - **Action**: Add a newline character to the end of the file.
   - **Missing Module Docstring**:
     - **Description**: The module lacks a docstring at the top.
     - **Action**: Add a docstring to describe the module's purpose.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       \"\"\"
       This module provides a bubble sort implementation along with a main function to execute it.
       \"\"\"
       ```
   - **Incorrect Module Naming**:
     - **Description**: The module name should follow snake_case.
     - **Action**: Change the module name to adhere to snake_case. Note: The module name is automatically generated and you might be unable to change it directly if it is part of a package unless it's part of your project structure.
     - **Example**: If renaming is possible, change `temp_code_2ee99b03-7ab8-4185-a3fc-7d52e81921e0.py` to `bubble_sort_utils.py`.
   - **Unused Variable**:
     - **Description**: Variable 'q' is defined but never used.
     - **Action**: Remove the unused variable, as it appears to be redundant.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       # Before
       q = int(input())
       sort1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())
       print(" ".join(map(str, ary)))
       print(cnt)

       # After
       sort1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())
       print(" ".join(map(str, ary)))
       print(cnt)
       ```

2. **Code Performance Optimization** (Optional):
   - **Bubble Sort**: Although the task is to improve code quality, it's worth noting that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm. Consider using a more efficient algorithm like quicksort or mergesort for larger datasets, but this changes the algorithmic approach which seems outside this specific task’s scope.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       from typing import List, Tuple

       def quicksort(ary: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], int]:
           if len(ary) <= 1:
               return ary, 0
           pivot = ary[len(ary) // 2]
           left = [x for x in ary if x < pivot]
           middle = [x for x in ary if x == pivot]
           right = [x for x in ary if x > pivot]
           sorted_left, cnt_left = quicksort(left)
           sorted_right, cnt_right = quicksort(right)
           return sorted_left + middle + sorted_right, cnt_left + cnt_right + len(left) * len(right)
       ```

### Conclusion
By addressing these issues, the code will adhere more closely to Python coding standards, leading to better readability, maintainability, and a higher code quality score. Even small stylistic improvements can significantly enhance the overall quality of the codebase.
