#### 1. **Clang Tidy (Static Analysis)**
- **Results:** No errors or warnings found.
- **Status:** Success.
- **Summary:** The code has passed the static analysis step without any issues, indicating that it adheres to the coding standards and rules covered by Clang Tidy.

#### 2. **Valgrind (Dynamic Memory Analysis)**
- **Results:** No memory issues detected, such as memory leaks, invalid reads/writes, or uninitialized values.
- **Status:** Success.
- **Summary:** The dynamic memory analysis did not uncover any memory-related issues, which is a strong indicator of clean and safe memory usage in the code.

#### 3. **Dafny (Formal Verification)**
- **Results:** No code provided for verification.
- **Summary:** Dafny could not perform any verification because no code was provided to it. This tool can help ensure that the code meets formal specification requirements but was not utilized for this evaluation.

#### 4. **RankMe (Code Quality Metric)**
- **Score:** 2.1753277471610737
- **Summary:** The RankMe score indicates that the code's general quality, measured by aspects such as readability, maintainability, and style, could be improved.

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths:**
  - The code has no static analysis errors, and no memory issues were detected, indicating solidness in code correctness and safety.
  - It follows standard practices and coding guidelines without introducing potential bugs.
  
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Dafny could not be utilized because no formal specifications were provided, which means the code has not been formally verified with respect to its intended behavior.
  - The RankMe score indicates room for improvement regarding code quality metrics.

### Actionable Tips for Improvement
#### Improve Code Quality According to RankMe Metrics
1. **Enhance Readability:**
   - *Tip:* Use more descriptive variable names if applicable. For this code, since `i` and `j` are common loop counters, it's fine, but in more complex loops, consider clearer names.
   
2. **Improve Maintainability:**
   - *Tip:* This code is already simple, but if it grows in complexity, consider adding comments, refactoring into functions, and following a modular structure.
   
3. **Consistent Style:**
   - *Tip:* Ensure consistent formatting across the codebase, such as whitespace and indentation. Use a tool like `clang-format` to automatically format your code.
   
   *Example:* 
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstdio>

   // Function to print multiplication table up to n
   void printMultiplicationTable(int n) {
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
               printf("%dx%d = %d\n", i, j, i * j);
           }
       }
   }

   int main() {
       printMultiplicationTable(10);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

#### Utilize Formal Verification
1. **Provide Specifications:**
   - *Tip:* Write formal specifications in Dafny or another formal verification tool to specify the intended behavior of the code. This can help catch logical errors and ensure the code behaves as expected.
   
2. **Analyze and Refine:**
   - *Tip:* Use the formal verification tool's results to agree or refine your code, ensuring both correctness and efficiency.

By focusing on these areas, the code can be improved both in terms of quality metrics and ensuring its behavior meets rigorous standards.

### Actionable Tips on How to Improve the Code Quality

Despite the high score, there are always areas of improvement and best practices to adhere to, especially in terms of readability and modern C++ practices:

#### 1. Use `std::iostream` Instead of `std::cout` and `std::cin`
- **Why**: This makes it clear which part of the standard library is being used.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  std::cin >> a >> b;
  std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << std::endl;
  ```

#### 2. Avoid Using `using namespace std;`
- **Why**: It avoids namespace pollution, especially in larger projects. If functions from `std` are needed frequently, one could use `using std::cin;`, `using std::cout;`, etc.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  #include<iostream>
  #include<cmath>

  int main()
  {
      int a, b;

      while (std::cin >> a >> b){
          std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << std::endl;
      }

      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Consider Using `std::endl` Prudently
- **Why**: `std::endl` not only inserts a newline but also flushes the stream, which can be costly performance-wise. Use `"\n"` for line breaks if flushing is not necessary.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << "\n";
  ```

#### 4. Handle Edge Cases and Input Validation
- **Why**: Ensures robustness and prevents undefined behavior due to invalid input.
- **Example**: Consider what happens when `a + b` is negative (e.g., undefined behavior if using `log10` directly). Additionally, handle cases where input might not be integers.
- **Example Impl**:
  ```cpp
  #include<iostream>
  #include<cmath>
  #include<limits>       // for numeric_limits

  int main()
  {
      int a, b;

      while (std::cin >> a >> b){
          if (a + b < 0) {
              std::cerr << "Error: The sum of a and b must be non-negative.\n";
              // Optionally handle the error, here we just skip
              std::cin.clear();  // clear the error flag on cin
              std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');  // discard invalid input
              continue;
          }
          std::cout << (a + b == 0 ? 1 : (int)(log10(a + b) + 1)) << "\n";
      }

      return 0;
  }
  ```

### Actionable Tips on How to Improve Code Quality and Performance

1. **Improve Variable Naming:**
   - **Reason:** Descriptive variable names improve code readability and maintainability.
   - **Action:** Rename variables `iN`, `iNum`, `Temp` to more descriptive names.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     int numberOfTests;
     cin >> numberOfTests;

     for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTests; i++) {
         int numbers[3];
         for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
             cin >> numbers[j];
         }

         for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
             for (int k = j + 1; k < 3; k++) {
                 if (numbers[j] > numbers[k]) {
                    int temp = numbers[j];
                    numbers[j] = numbers[k];
                    numbers[k] = temp;
                 }
             }
         }

         if ((numbers[0] * numbers[0]) + (numbers[1] * numbers[1]) == (numbers[2] * numbers[2])) {
             cout << "YES" << endl;
         } else {
             cout << "NO" << endl;
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Use Constants for Array Size:**
   - **Reason:** Defining a constant for the size of the array improves flexibility and readability.
   - **Action:** Define a constant for the array size.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     const int ARRAY_SIZE = 3;
     int numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];
     ```

3. **Use STL for Sorting:**
   - **Reason:** Using the C++ Standard Library (STL) functions improves code efficiency and clarity.
   - **Action:** Replace the sorting logic with `std::sort`.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <algorithm> // For std::sort
     ...
     for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTests; i++) {
         int numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];
         for (int j = 0; j < ARRAY_SIZE; j++) {
             cin >> numbers[j];
         }

         std::sort(numbers, numbers + ARRAY_SIZE);

         if ((numbers[0] * numbers[0]) + (numbers[1] * numbers[1]) == (numbers[2] * numbers[2])) {
             cout << "YES" << endl;
         } else {
             cout << "NO" << endl;
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Avoid Using `using namespace std;`:**
   - **Reason:** This can lead to name conflicts and is considered a bad practice in larger projects.
   - **Action:** Remove `using namespace std;` and prefix standard library calls with `std::`.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     // #include <iostream>
     // using namespace std;
     #include <iostream>

     int main()
     {
         int numberOfTests;
         std::cin >> numberOfTests;

         for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTests; i++) {
             int numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];
             for (int j = 0; j < ARRAY_SIZE; j++) {
                 std::cin >> numbers[j];
             }

             std::sort(numbers, numbers + ARRAY_SIZE);

             if ((numbers[0] * numbers[0]) + (numbers[1] * numbers[1]) == (numbers[2] * numbers[2])) {
                 std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;
             } else {
                 std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
             }
         }

         return 0;
     }
     ```

By following the above improvements, the code will become more readable, maintainable, and flexible, contributing to a higher quality codebase.

2024-12-02 22:15:11,497 - INFO - Final output: ### Analysis of Evaluation Results

#### 1. Clang-Tidy (Static Analysis)
- **Command**: `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_31e1defa-8ba5-4f2d-8534-1ebf7621670f.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **File**: `temp/code_files/temp_code_31e1defa-8ba5-4f2d-8534-1ebf7621670f.cpp`
- **Return Code**: `0`
- **Status**: `success`
- **Errors**: None
- **Warnings**: None

**Summary**: Clang-Tidy did not report any errors or warnings in the code using the provided checks. This indicates that the code adheres to the coding standards and practices checked by Clang-Tidy, which is a good sign for maintaining clean and maintainable code.

#### 2. Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score**: 10
- **Static Analysis**: 10

**Summary**: The final evaluation score is 10, indicating perfect compliance with the checked static analysis rules. No issues were flagged that could affect the overall score.

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**:
- The code passes all static analysis checks by Clang-Tidy.
- The code handles division by zero when calculating the determinant (`denom`), which is crucial for avoiding runtime errors.
- The use of `typedef` and macros for common constructs makes the code more readable and maintainable.

**Weaknesses**:
- Consider avoiding the use of `using namespace std;` to prevent name collisions in larger programs.
- Macros can sometimes lead to less readable and maintainable code due to preprocessor expansion issues. Consider using `const` or `constexpr` variables instead.
- The `fixed` and `setprecision` manipulators always set the precision to 3 decimal places, which may not be optimal for all use cases.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Avoid `using namespace std;`**:
   - **Why**: This can lead to namespace conflicts in larger codebases.
   - **Action**: Replace `using namespace std;` with explicit usage of the `std` namespace.
     ```cpp
     // Include this instead of 'using namespace std;'
     #include <iostream>
     #include <iomanip>

     int main() {
         std::cin.tie(0);
         std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
         std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(3);

         int a, b, c, d, e, f;
         while (std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e >> f) {
             double denom = (double)(b * d - a * e);
             if (denom != 0.0) {
                 double y = (double)(c * d - a * f) / denom;
                 double x = (c - b * y) / a;
                 std::cout << x << " " << y << "\n";
             } else {
                 std::cout << "Parallel lines or no solution\n";
             }
         }

         return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Replace Macros with `const` or `constexpr` Variables**:
   - **Why**: Macros can lead to unexpected behavior due to preprocessor expansion.
   - **Action**: Replace macros like `INF`, constants like `PI`, and placeholders like `FOR`, `REP`, `ALL`, `pb`, `fi`, `se` with appropriate `const` or `constexpr` variables.
     ```cpp
     constexpr double INF = 1e18;
     constexpr double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

     // Replace ALL, FOR, REP, etc. with appropriate loops or functions
     // Example:
     #undef ALL
     #define ALL(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()

     int main() {
         // Use the constants and avoid macros
         double my_pi = PI;
         double infinity = INF;
     }
     ```

3. **Consider Flexible Precision Settings**:
   - **Why**: The current precision setting might not be suitable for all cases.
   - **Action**: Allow the user to specify the precision or set it conditionally based on the problem requirements.
     ```cpp
     // Allow user to input precision or set it with a condition
     int precision = 3;  // This can be an input or derived from some conditions
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(precision);

     // Example: Conditional precision
     if (some_condition) {
         precision = 5;
     }
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(precision);
     ```

By implementing these changes, the code can become more robust, readable, and maintainable, further improving its quality and performance.

- **Status**: Success
- **Return Code**: 0
- **Errors**: None
- **Warnings**: None

### Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score**: 10
- **Static Analysis Score**: 10

## 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

### Strengths
- **No Errors or Warnings**: The Clang-Tidy analysis did not identify any issues, indicating that the code adheres to best practices and does not have syntax errors or common programming pitfalls.
- **Perfect Scores**: Both the final score and the static analysis score are 10, reflecting high quality and correctness.

### Potential Areas for Improvement
- **Use of `using namespace std;`**: While this doesn't cause an error, it can lead to name conflicts and is considered bad practice in larger projects.
- **Code Clarity and Readability**: Although the code is correct, it can be improved for better readability and maintainability.

## 3. Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Score

### Specific Suggestions

#### 1. Avoid Using `using namespace std;`
- **Issue**: Using `using namespace std;` can cause name conflicts when including multiple libraries, as it introduces every name in the `std` namespace into the global namespace.
- **Solution**: Replace `using namespace std;` with explicit `std::` namespace qualifications.

  **Example**:
  ```cpp
  // Before
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
      cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // Relies on 'using namespace std;'
  }

  // After
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
      std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // Explicitly uses 'std::'
  }
  ```

#### 2. Add Comments and Documentation
- **Issue**: The code is concise but lacks comments or documentation, which can make it harder for others (or yourself) to understand the code in the future.
- **Solution**: Add comments to explain the purpose, usage, and logic of the code.

  **Example**:
  ```cpp
  // Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
  unsigned int comp_GCD(unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
      while (b != 0) {
          unsigned int r = a % b;
          a = b;
          b = r;
      }
      return a;
  }

  int main() {
      unsigned int a, b;
      vector<unsigned int> result_gcd;
      vector<unsigned int> result_lcm;

      // Read pairs of numbers from input until EOF.
      while (cin >> a >> b) {
          unsigned int gcd = comp_GCD(a, b);
          result_gcd.push_back(gcd);
          result_lcm.push_back(a * b / gcd); // Calculate LCM using the relation LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b)
      }

      // Output the results.
      for (unsigned int i = 0; i < result_gcd.size(); i++) {
          cout << result_gcd[i] << " " << result_lcm[i] << endl;
      }
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Consider Robustness and Edge Cases
- **Issue**: While the code handles typical cases, it does not handle possible edge cases such as division by zero or overflow.
- **Solution**: Add checks and handle edge cases appropriately.

  **Example**:
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <vector>
  #include <limits> // For std::numeric_limits

  using namespace std;

  unsigned int comp_GCD(unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
      while (b != 0) {
          unsigned int r = a % b;
          a = b;
          b = r;
      }
      return a;
  }

  int main() {
      unsigned int a, b;
      vector<unsigned int> result_gcd;
      vector<unsigned int> result_lcm;

      while (cin >> a >> b) {
          // Handle edge case where both a and b are zero
          if (a == 0 && b == 0) {
              cerr << "Error: GCD and LCM are undefined for both numbers being zero." << endl;
              continue;
          }

          // Handle potential overflow
          if (a > std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max() / b) {
              cerr << "Error: Multiplication would cause overflow." << endl;
              continue;
          }

          unsigned int gcd = comp_GCD(a, b);
          result_gcd.push_back(gcd);
          result_lcm.push_back(a * b / gcd);
      }

      // Output the results.
      for (unsigned int i = 0; i < result_gcd.size(); i++) {
          cout << result_gcd[i] << " " << result_lcm[i] << endl;
      }
      return 0;
  }
  ```

By implementing these changes, you can enhance the robustness, readability, and maintainability of the code while preserving its correctness and performance.

2024-12-02 22:45:54,448 - INFO - Final output: ### 1. Summary of Analysis Results for Each Included Tool

#### Clang-Tidy:
- **Command:** `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_6de23a06-bcfc-40a1-a0c3-76b8dc62c1d4.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **File:** `temp/code_files/temp_code_6de23a06-bcfc-40a1-a0c3-76b8dc62c1d4.cpp`
- **Status:** `failure`
- **Return Code:** `1`
- **Errors:** [] 
- **Warnings:** []

**Observations:**
Clang-Tidy was invoked with all checks except for specific clang diagnostic warnings, treating warnings as errors. Despite running the analysis, the status shown is `failure` with a return code of `1` indicating that Clang-Tidy encountered issues during the analysis, but the exact errors are not listed. 

### 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

#### Key Issues:
- **Suspicious Status:** The analysis status is `failure`, which seems unexpected given that there are no errors or warnings explicitly listed. This indicates a potential issue with the command setup or the environment in which Clang-Tidy was run.
- **Use of `using namespace std;`:** This is considered bad practice as it can lead to name collisions and decreases code clarity.

#### Key Strengths:
- The generated code is simple and performs the intended functionality of reversing a string input by the user.
- No reported errors or warnings by Clang-Tidy (though it failed to execute successfully), indicating that the code does not have any serious syntactical or logical errors (unless the failure is due to other issues not captured in the output).

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

#### Fixing the Clang-Tidy Failure:
1. **Verify the Clang-Tidy Installation:** Ensure that Clang-Tidy is correctly installed and that the correct path is used.
2. **Check the File Path:** Confirm that the file path provided to Clang-Tidy is correct and that the file is accessible.
3. **Check for Environment Issues:** Sometimes, environment-specific issues could cause Clang-Tidy to fail. Make sure there are no upcoming IO or permission issues with the file.
4. **Review the Command Parameters:** Examine if the parameters passed to Clang-Tidy are correct and suitable for the task. `-Werror` flags warnings as errors, which may be undesirable; consider removing it if warnings are being treated as problematic failures.
   
#### Improve the Code Quality:
1. **Avoid `using namespace std;`:** Instead of using `using namespace std;`, explicitly qualify the standard library names to avoid namespace pollution and potential name clashes with other libraries.
   ```cpp
   // before
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>
   
   using namespace std;
   
   int main() {
       string s;
       cin >> s;
       reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
       cout << s << endl;
       return 0;
   }

   // after
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   int main() {
       std::string s;
       std::cin >> s;
       std::reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
       std::cout << s << std::endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   
2. **Consider Input Validation:** While the simple code shown will work for valid inputs, adding input validation can make the code more robust and user-friendly.
   ```cpp
   // after input validation
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   int main() {
       std::string s;

       if (std::getline(std::cin, s)) { // read a line of input
           std::reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
           std::cout << s << std::endl;
       } else {
           std::cerr << "Error reading input." << std::endl;
           return 1;
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```
   
3. **Consistent Return Codes:** Ensure that your code has explicit and consistent return codes for different conditions, as illustrated in the improved example above.
   
4. **Error Handling for Reverse Function:** Although `std::reverse` does not throw exceptions and will work as expected for strings, for broader error management, consider checking the state of the input or handling potential exceptions (if using other STL algorithms).

By addressing both the Clang-Tidy setup issues and refactoring the code to improve maintainability and robustness, the code's quality and confidence in its correctness can be significantly enhanced.

1. **Clang-Tidy (Static Analysis)**
   - **Command**: `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_eac8eed0-4edc-4f00-85a8-71fef7e983e7.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
   - **Status**: `success`
   - **Return Code**: `0`
   - **Errors and Warnings**: None identified
   - **Summary**: The code passed the Clang-Tidy static analysis with no errors or warnings, indicating that it adheres to coding standards and best practices enforced by this tool.

2. **Final Evaluation Score**
   - **Static Analysis Score**: `10`
   - **Final Score**: `10`
   - **Summary**: The code received a perfect score for static analysis, which reflects high quality in terms of adherence to standards and absence of any identified issues.

### Key Strengths

- No compile-time or logical errors were identified.
- The code structure is straightforward and easy to understand.

### Key Weaknesses
- **None Identified**: Given the perfect score, there are no critical issues or weaknesses that the analysed tools detected.

### Actionable Tips

1. **Improve Readability and Maintainability**
   - **Use Meaningful Variable Names**: Enhance the readability by using more descriptive variable names than generic ones like `base` and `n`.
     - **Example**: Rename `base` to `principal` and `n` to `years`, assuming this is a financial calculation-related snippet.
   - **Add Comments**: Comment to describe the purpose of the operations and any complex logic.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       // Increase the principal by 5% per year
       base = static_cast<long long>(1.05 * base);
       
       // Adjust to the nearest thousand
       if (base % 1000 != 0) {
           base = (base / 1000) * 1000 + 1000;
       } else {
           base = (base / 1000) * 1000;
       }
       ```

2. **Code Optimization**
   - **Avoid Redundant Calculations**: If `base` is consistently divisible by 1000 before the conditional check, the else clause can be removed:
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       base = static_cast<long long>(1.05 * base);
       base = ((base + 999) / 1000) * 1000; // Rounds up to the nearest thousand in one step
       ```

3. **Consider Range and Overflow**
   - **Check for Valid Input Values**: Ensure that the user input (`n`) is within an acceptable range to prevent overflow or unintended behavior, especially given that `base` is of type `long long`.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       if (n < 0 || n > 10000) { // Example range check
           std::cerr << "Invalid number of years." << std::endl;
           return 1;
       }
       ```

4. **Enhance User Interaction**
   - **Provide User Feedback**: Before reading `n`, prompt the user to enter the required value.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       std::cout << "Enter the number of years: ";
       std::cin >> n;
       ```

By implementing these suggestions, the code will not only maintain its current high quality but will also improve in terms of readability, maintainability, and robustness.

- **Status:** `success`
- **Errors:** None detected
- **Warnings:** None detected

#### Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score:** `10`
- **Static Analysis Score:** `10`

### Key Issues & Strengths

**Strengths:**
- The code successfully passes all checks from Clang-Tidy without any errors or warnings, indicating it adheres to best coding practices and does not have easily detectable issues.
- The final score of `10` suggests the code performs adequately based on the static analysis.

**Key Issues:**
- Despite the passing grade, there are logical areas where improvements can be made for code efficiency and readability.

### Actionable Tips for Improvement

1. **Variable Naming Conventions:**
   - Strengthen the naming conventions for variables to make it easier to understand the purpose of each variable.
     - **Original Code:**
       ```cpp
       int n, i, a, b, c, d, ans = 0;
       ```
     - **Improved Code:**
       ```cpp
       int input_number, iteration_count, digit1, digit2, digit3, digit4, valid_count = 0;
       ```
   
2. **Logical Issues:**
   - The condition inside the `if` statement contains a typo (`&&&` instead of `&&`). Although this error was not picked up by Clang-Tidy, it could lead to issues if such a typo were present in the actual code.
     - **Original Code:**
       ```cpp
       if(n > 0 &&& n <= 36)  // Use && instead of &&&
       ```
     - **Improved Code:**
       ```cpp
       if(n > 0 && n <= 36)
       ```
   - The logical `else if` containing the break condition could be refactored to simplify the control flow.
     - **Original Code:**
       ```cpp
       else if(n <= 0 || n > 50)
       {
         break;
       }
       ```
     - **Improved Code (Consider using an early exit):**
       ```cpp
       if (n <= 0 || n > 50) {
         break;
       }
       ```

3. **Code Efficiency:**
   - The nested loops used to calculate the sum of digits are straightforward but could be improved to reduce the number of iterations. For example, by limiting the ranges of `digit1`, `digit2`, `digit3`, and `digit4` based on the remaining sum, we could significantly reduce the number of iterations.
     - **Optimization Example:**
       The current implementation tests up to 10,000 combinations (10x10x10x10) for each number. We can reduce this by adjusting the ranges of subsequent loops based on the sum requirements.
       ```cpp
       for(a = 0; a <= 9 && n >= a; a++) {
           for(b = 0; b <= 9 && n - a >= b; b++) {
               for(c = 0; c <= 9 && n - a - b >= c; c++) {
                   digit4 = n - a - b - c;
                   if (digit4 >= 0 && digit4 <= 9) {
                       valid_count++;
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       ```

4. **Code Readability:**
   - Adding comments and blank lines can help separate logical sections of the code, making it easier to understand.
     - **Improved Version with Comments:**
       ```cpp
       /*************************************
        * Main Function
        * Description:
        *   This function reads integers from the user and calculates the number
        *   of 4-digit combinations where the sum of the digits equals the input number.
        *************************************/
       int main(void)
       {
         int input_number, iteration_count = 0, digit1, digit2, digit3, digit4, valid_count = 0;

         while(iteration_count < 50)
         {
           scanf("%d", &input_number);

           valid_count = 0;

           // Validate input number
           if(input_number > 0 && input_number <= 36)
           {
             // Iterate over all possible 4-digit combinations
             for(digit1 = 0; digit1 <= 9 && input_number - digit1 >= 0; digit1++)
             {
               for(digit2 = 0; digit2 <= 9 && input_number - digit1 - digit2 >= 0; digit2++)
               {
                 for(digit3 = 0; digit3 <= 9 && input_number - digit1 - digit2 - digit3 >= 0; digit3++)
                 {
                   digit4 = input_number - digit1 - digit2 - digit3;
                   if (digit4 >= 0 && digit4 <= 9) {
                     valid_count++;
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
           else {
             break;
           }

           printf("%d\n", valid_count);
           iteration_count++;
         }
         return 0;
       }
       ```

By implementing these improvements, the code becomes more readable, efficient, and robust, thus enhancing overall quality and performance.

2024-12-02 23:09:01,149 - INFO - Final output: ### 1. Summary of Analysis Results for Each Included Tool

#### Clang-Tidy
- **Command:** `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_a9c7db3f-5a00-41cb-b5a2-c119c36f7d88.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **Status:** Success
- **Errors and Warnings:** None

### 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths
#### Clang-Tidy
- **Strength:** Clang-Tidy did not detect any errors or warnings, indicating that the code aligns with C++ best practices and adheres to common coding standards.

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

#### General Improvements:
- **Code Readability:** Improve the readability of the code by adding comments and meaningful variable names where applicable.
- **Memory Usage:** Ensure that the memory usage is optimized, especially since global variables `dp` and `isprime` are declared outside of `main()`. For very large values of `N` (e.g., 1,000,001 integers), verify that memory consumption is within acceptable limits.

#### Code-Specific Suggestions:
- **Variable Names:** Use more descriptive variable names, especially `dp` and `isprime`.
- **Comments:** Add comments to explain the logic of your algorithm, especially the segment where the sieve of Eratosthenes is applied.
- **Input Validation:** While the input validation in the `while` loop seems correct, consider adding validation for edge cases such as negative numbers or zero if they are not expected.
- **Constants Naming:** Use `const` variables with uppercase letters for constants like `N` (`MAX_FRAME` could be a better name).

#### Example Improvements:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

const int MAX_FRAMES = 1000009;
int primeCountUpTo[MAX_FRAMES];
int isNotPrime[MAX_FRAMES];

int main() {
    // Sieve of Eratosthenes
    memset(isNotPrime, 0, sizeof(isNotPrime));
    primeCountUpTo[1] = 0;

    for(int i = 2; i < MAX_FRAMES; i++) {
        if(!isNotPrime[i]) {
            for(int j = 2 * i; j < MAX_FRAMES; j += i) {
                isNotPrime[j] = 1;
            }
            primeCountUpTo[i] = primeCountUpTo[i - 1] + 1;
        } else {
            primeCountUpTo[i] = primeCountUpTo[i - 1];
        }
    }

    int query;
    // Process each query until EOF or zero is encountered
    while(scanf("%d", &query) != EOF && query > 0) {
        printf("%d\n", primeCountUpTo[query]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Score

#### 1. Add Comments
**Why:** Comments are essential for code maintenance and readability. They help other developers (or your future self) understand the purpose and flow of the code more easily.

**How:** Add comments at the function level and critical sections of code.
**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    // Read the size of the vector from input
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    std::vector<int> v(w);

    // Initialize the vector with values from 1 to w
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        v[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Read the number of swap operations
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    // Perform the specified number of swaps
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        int a, b;
        char c; // This variable is likely a placeholder for the operation (e.g., '=', but not used here)
        std::cin >> a >> c >> b;
        std::swap(v[a - 1], v[b - 1]);
    }

    // Output the final state of the vector
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        std::cout << v[i] << (i < w - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. Add Input Validation
**Why:** It's crucial to validate user inputs to prevent undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.

**How:** Check that the input values are within expected ranges.
**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    if (w <= 0) { // Ensure w is a positive integer
        std::cerr << "Invalid size for vector.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    std::vector<int> v(w);
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        v[i] = i + 1;
    }

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n < 0) { // Ensure n is non-negative
        std::cerr << "Invalid number of operations.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        int a, b;
        char c;
        std::cin >> a >> c >> b;
        if (a <= 0 || b <= 0 || a > w || b > w) { // Ensure a and b are within valid range
            std::cerr << "Invalid indices for swap operation.\n";
            return 1;
        }
        std::swap(v[a - 1], v[b - 1]);
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        std::cout << v[i] << (i < w - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Use Range-Based Loops for Traversal
**Why:** Range-based for loops can make the code cleaner and are less prone to errors (like off-by-one errors).

**How:** Replace traditional loops with range-based loops where applicable.
**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    int w;
    std::cin >> w;
    if (w <= 0) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid size for vector.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    std::vector<int> v(w);
    for(int i = 0; i < w; ++i){
        v[i] = i + 1;
    }

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    if (n < 0) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid number of operations.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        int a, b;
        char c;
        std::cin >> a >> c >> b;
        if (a <= 0 || b <= 0 || a > w || b > w) {
            std::cerr << "Invalid indices for swap operation.\n";
            return 1;
        }
        std::swap(v[a - 1], v[b - 1]);
    }

    for (int value : v) { // Use a range-based for loop for output
        std::cout << value << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Final Thoughts
Your code is in good shape, with no apparent issues from a static analysis perspective. Enhancing it with comments, input validation, and range-based loops will make it more robust and easier to maintain.

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

- **Line Too Long**: (Pylint issue - line-too-long)
  - **Problem**: The line exceeds the allowed character length.
  - **Solution**: Split the long line into multiple lines or adjust the code for brevity.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    tri = list(map(int, input().split()))
    tri.sort()
    if tri[0]**2 + tri[1]**2 == tri[2]**2:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
    ```

- **Missing Final Newline**: (Pylint issue - missing-final-newline)
  - **Problem**: The file does not end with a newline.
  - **Solution**: Simply add a newline at the end of the file.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    # End of file (extra newline here)
    ```

- **Module Name does not conform to snake_case**: (Pylint issue - invalid-name)
  - **Problem**: The filename does not follow the snake_case naming convention, which is the recommended style for Python modules.
  - **Solution**: Rename the file to conform to snake_case, such as `right_angle_detector.py`.
  - **Example**: `temp_code_9cb3bc21-599f-4191-876e-14bc47f8340c.py` → `right_angle_detector.py`

  """
  This module contains a main function that reads pairs of integers from the input,
  calculates their GCD and LCM, and prints the results. It handles invalid input gracefully
  and exits on EOF.
  """
  ```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Issue**: The module name does not conform to the PEP 8 naming convention (snake_case).
- **Action**: Rename the module to follow the snake_case naming convention.
- **Example**: `gcd_lcm_calculator.py`

#### Final Newline
- **Issue**: Missing final newline.
- **Action**: Add an extra newline at the end of the file.
- **Example**: Ensure the file ends with a blank line.
  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()

  ```

By addressing these minor stylistic and documentation issues, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code while adhering to PEP 8 guidelines. This will make it easier for others to understand and contribute to your code in the future.

     ```python
     """
     This module provides a function to calculate the final amount after a specified number of years.
     """
     ```
   - **Naming Convention**: Rename the module to a proper snake_case naming.
     - Example: If this was a file, rename it to `calculate_amount.py`.
   - **Variable Redefinition**: Avoid using the same name 'n' for both the input variable and the function's parameter.
     ```python
     num_years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))
     print(calculate_final_amount(num_years))
     ```
   - **Import Order**: Place all imports at the top of the module.
     ```python
     import math

     def calculate_final_amount(n):
         ...
     ```

2. **Enhance Code Readability**:
   - Improving naming conventions and readability will aid in overall understanding and maintenance.
   - Use additional comments and docstrings to explain complex logic, especially if it is not self-explanatory.

3. **Finalized Code Example**:
   ```python
   """
   This module provides a function to calculate the final amount after a specified number of years.
   """

   import math

   def calculate_final_amount(n):
       """
       Calculate the final amount after n years with an annual increase of 5%
       and rounding up each year.

       :param n: Number of years
       :return: Final amount multiplied by 1000
       """
       m = 100.0
       for _ in range(n):
           m = math.ceil(m * 1.05)
       return int(m * 1000)


   if __name__ == "__main__":
       num_years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))
       print(calculate_final_amount(num_years))
   ```

By addressing the identified issues and following these tips, the code's quality and maintainability can be significantly improved.

2024-12-03 00:14:19,162 - INFO - Final output: ### Summary of Evaluation Results

#### 1. **Static Analysis Tool Results:**
   - **Tool: mypy**
     - **Result:** Success: No issues found in 1 source file.
     - **Highlights:** The code adheres to type annotations correctly, and mypy did not find any type-related issues.
  
   - **Tool: pylint**
     - **Result:** Code rated at 5.45/10. Multiple issues identified.
     - **Specific Issues Identified:**
       - **Missing Final Newline (missing-final-newline):** Last line of the code file should contain a newline character.
       - **Missing Module Docstring (missing-module-docstring):** The module `temp_code_44097cff-d969-40ed-9e08-a3fea57a8b7d` is missing a docstring.
       - **Invalid Name for Module (invalid-name):** The module name does not follow the snake_case naming style.
       - **Redefining Variable (redefined-outer-name):** The variable `n` is redefined from the outer scope, which may cause confusion.
       - **Unnecessary `elif` After `return` (no-else-return):** The `elif` statement is unnecessary because the `return` in the `if` block terminates the function.

   - **Tool: bandit**
     - **Result:** No issues identified.
     - **Highlights:** Bandit, which checks for security issues in Python code, found no potential security problems in the code.

#### 2. **Key Strengths & Weaknesses**
   - **Strengths:**
     - **Type Safety:** The code does not trigger any issues related to type safety, meaning it uses Python’s type hinting effectively.
     - **Security:** Bandit did not find any security concerns with the code, indicating there are no obvious vulnerabilities.
     - **Readability for Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci function is well-documented with a clear docstring.
   
   - **Weaknesses:**
     - **Pylint Issues:** The code has several issues that affect Pylint's rating:
       - Missing docstrings for the module-level (module docstring).
       - Naming convention violations.
       - Potential confusion from redefined variable names.
       - Unnecessary `elif` statements.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Address Pylint Issues:**
   - **Add a Module Docstring:** Include a summary of the module's functionality at the top of the file, before any classes and functions.
     ```python
     """
     This module provides functions to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
     """
     ```
   - **Module Naming Convention:** Rename the module file to follow the snake_case naming style. For example, `fibonacci_calculator.py`.
   - **Avoid Redefining Outer Variables:** Refrain from reusing variable names like `n` within the scope of the function to prevent confusion.
     ```python
     # Read input from the user
     input_n = int(input())
     print(fibonacci(input_n))
     ```
   - **Remove Unnecessary `elif`:** Simplify the conditional structure by removing the `elif` when the `return` in the `if` block ensures no further execution is needed.
     ```python
     def fibonacci(n):
         """
         Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach to optimize space complexity.
         """
         if n <= 0:
             return 0
         if n == 1:
             return 1

         pair = [1, 1]
         for i in range(2, n + 1):
             pair[i % 2] = sum(pair)

         return pair[n % 2]
     ```
   - **Final Newline:** Ensure that the last line of the file is an empty newline by pressing Enter at the end of the last line in your text editor.

2. **Code Organization and Standards:**
   - **Docstrings for Functions:** Always include docstrings for each function to describe its purpose, parameters, and output.
   - **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8) style guide for writing clean and consistent code.
     - Use consistent indentation (4 spaces per indentation level).
     - Ensure there are two blank lines between top-level functions and class definitions.
     - Use spaces around operators and after commas.
     - Keep line length to a maximum of 79 characters.

By addressing these issues, the code will not only improve its quality according to standard Python coding conventions but ensure it is more maintainable and robust.

- **Security**: No security issues detected by bandit, suggesting that the code is safe from common vulnerabilities.

#### **Weaknesses**
- **Lack of Documentation**: Both module and function docstrings are absent, which hinders understanding and maintenance.
- **Code Style and Naming**: The module name and variable `C` violate PEP 8 naming conventions.
- **Type Checking**: Functions are untyped by default, which reduces safety and catch errors at compile time.

### Actionable Tips for Improvement

1. **Add Docstrings**:
   - **Module Docstring**: Provide a high-level summary of what the module does.
   - **Function Docstring**: Explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of the `main` function.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     """
     This module processes input data representing a graph and computes discovery and finishing times using Depth-First Search (DFS).
     """
     
     def main():
         """
         Reads input graph data, performs DFS to compute discovery and finishing times, and prints these times for each node.
         """
     ```

2. **Improve Naming Conventions**:
   - **Module Name**: Rename the module to a snake_case name, such as `graph_dfs.py`.
   - **Variable Naming**: Rename `C` to a more descriptive name like `adjacency_list`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def main():
         adjacency_list: List[deque[int]] = [deque() for _ in range(n + 1)]
     ```

3. **Enable Type Checking for All Functions**:
   - **Use --check-untyped-defs**: Run mypy with the `--check-untyped-defs` option to check the bodies of untyped functions.
   - **Add Type Annotations**: Explicitly define types for function arguments and return values.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from collections import deque
     from typing import List

     def main() -> None:
         q: deque[int] = deque()

         n: int = int(input())
         adjacency_list: List[deque[int]] = [deque() for _ in range(n + 1)]

         for _ in range(n):
             tmp: List[int] = list(map(int, input().split()))
             for j in range(1, tmp[0]):
                 adjacency_list[tmp[0]].append(tmp[j])

         visited: List[bool] = [False] * (n + 1)
         discovery_times: List[int] = [0] * (n + 1)
         finishing_times: List[int] = [0] * (n + 1)
         timestamp: int = 0

         def dfs(node: int) -> None:
             nonlocal timestamp
             q.append(node)
             while q:
                 node = q[-1]
                 if discovery_times[node] == 0:
                     timestamp += 1
                     discovery_times[node] = timestamp
                 visited[node] = True
                 found_unvisited: bool = False
                 while adjacency_list[node]:
                     neighbor: int = adjacency_list[node].popleft()
                     if not visited[neighbor]:
                         q.append(neighbor)
                         found_unvisited = True
                         break
                 if not found_unvisited:
                     timestamp += 1
                     finishing_times[q.pop()] = timestamp

         for i in range(1, n + 1):
             if not visited[i]:
                 dfs(i)

         for i in range(1, n + 1):
             print(f"{i} {discovery_times[i]} {finishing_times[i]}")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     ```

4. **Add a Final Newline**:
   - **Method**: Ensure there is a newline at the end of the Python file.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     \n  # <newline character>
     ```

By addressing these issues, you can boost code quality and maintainability, making it easier to read, understand, and extend in the future.

2024-12-03 00:20:38,204 - INFO - Final output: Based on the provided JSON evaluation results, let's break down the analysis results for each tool and provide actionable tips to improve the code quality.

### 1. Summary of Analysis Results for Each Tool

**1.1. Mypy (Static Analysis)**
- **Results**: Success: no issues found in 1 source file.
- **Summary**: No type-related errors have been detected. The code appears to be type-safe if type hints are correctly inferred or explicitly defined.

**1.2. Pylint (Code Quality)**
- **Results**: Some coding style and naming convention issues present.
- **Summary**: The issues identified include:
  - Missing final newline at the end of the file.
  - Missing module-level documentation.
  - Invalid module name due to lack of adherence to snake_case.
  - Unused variable 'N' in the `main` function.
  - Improper naming conventions for variable names and function arguments.

**1.3. Bandit (Security Analysis)**
- **Results**: No issues identified.
- **Summary**: The code does not contain any security vulnerabilities related to Bandit's detection criteria.

### 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

**Strengths:**
- The code is type-safe according to mypy.
- No security vulnerabilities detected by Bandit.

**Weaknesses:**
- Non-compliance with style guidelines and naming conventions.
- Presence of an unused variable.

### 3. Actionable Tips to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

**3.1. Address Style and Naming Conventions:**
- **Add a module-level docstring**: Provide a brief description of the module to improve documentation.
  ```python
  """
  This module contains a simple implementation of the insertion sort algorithm
  in Python.
  """
  ```
- **Rename variables to comply with snake_case**: Variable names and function arguments should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores.
  ```python
  def insertion_sort(array):
      length = len(array)
      for i in range(1, length):
          value = array[i]
          j = i - 1
          while j >= 0 and array[j] > value:
              array[j + 1] = array[j]
              j -= 1
          array[j + 1] = value
  ```
- **Use better function and variable names**: Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the function or variable.
  ```python
  def sort_array_by_insertion(arr):
      list_length = len(arr)
      for idx in range(1, list_length):
          current_value = arr[idx]
          # ...
  ```

**3.2. Remove Unused Code:**
- **Remove the unused variable `N`**: The variable `N` in the `main` function is redundant because the length of `A` is not used.
  ```python
  def main():
      """
      Main function to read input and perform insertion sort.
      """
      num_elements = int(input())
      array = list(map(int, input().split()))
      # Remove the print below if it's not needed for testing
      print(' '.join(map(str, array)))
      sort_array_by_insertion(array)
  ```

**3.3. Ensure Readability and Maintainability:**
- **Add trailing newline**: Ensure the file ends with a newline character, as recommended by linting tools.
  ```python
  # Existing code stays the same, but ensure the file ends with a newline when saved.
  ```

**4. Additional Suggestions:**
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding basic error handling to manage invalid inputs.
- **Code Optimization**: Although insertion sort is not the most efficient for large datasets, ensure that the code performs well for expected inputs.
- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure the sorting function behaves as expected under various scenarios.

By addressing these style, naming, and optimization suggestions, the code will not only meet typical coding standards but also become more readable, maintainable, and robust.

2024-12-03 00:23:06,715 - INFO - Final output: ## Evaluation Summary

### 1. **Static Analysis Tool Results**

#### **Tool: mypy**
- **Score: Not Provided Explicitly**
- **Summary:** No issues were found in the code using mypy, a static type checker for Python. This indicates that the code is type-consistent according to the information provided, but no explicit score is given.

#### **Tool: pylint**
- **Score: 5.00/10**
- **Summary:** 
  - **Issues:**
    - Final newline is missing at the end of the file (missing-final-newline).
    - Module name does not conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name).
    - Redefinition of 'x' and 'y' from the outer scope (redefined-outer-name).

#### **Tool: bandit**
- **Score: Not Provided Explicitly**
- **Summary:** Bandit, a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code, found no issues in the provided code. Similar to mypy, no explicit score is provided.

### 2. **Highlights of Key Strengths and Weaknesses**

#### **Strengths:**
- **No Security Issues Detected by Bandit**: The code does not have any notable security flaws, based on bandit’s analysis.
- **Passes Mypy Type Checking**: Indicates type consistency in the code.

#### **Weaknesses:**
- **Low Pylint Score (5.00/10)**: Points out formatting issues, naming conventions, and potential confusion with variable redefinition.
- **Missing Final Newline**: Non-conformance with PEP8 style guidelines, which recommends that files end with a newline character.
- **Module Naming Conventions**: The automatically generated module name does not follow snake_case style conventions, as recommended by PEP8.
- **Confusing Variable Redefinitions**: Redefining 'x' and 'y' in the `gcd` function does not cause any bugs but may confuse readers (given the reuse of parameter names).

### 3. **Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality**

#### **Fixing Code Formatting and Naming Issues**

- **Add a Final Newline**: Ensure each file ends with a newline character to comply with PEP8.
  - **Example Fix:**
    ```python
    print(gcd(x, y))\n  # Note the additional newline after this line in your text editor.
    ```

- **Module Renaming**: Rename the file to a snake_case style name, such as `gcd_calculator.py`.
  - **Example Fix:**
    - File name: `gcd_calculator.py`
    - Rename file as: `gcđ_calculator.py`

- **Avoid Redefining Function Parameters** (to improve code readability):
  - **Example Fix:**
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b  # Use 'a' and 'b' instead of 'x' and 'y'
        return a

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        print(gcd(x, y))
    ```

- **Improve Input Validation and Error Handling**: Adding checks and error handling ensures robustness.
  - **Example Fix:**
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        try:
            x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            if len([x, y]) != 2:
                raise ValueError("Exactly two integers should be provided.")
            print(gcd(x, y))
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Input Error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    ```

#### **Final Thoughts**

While the initial evaluation results show a good final score, there are specific areas that need improvement to adhere to best practices in Python development. By addressing the formatting, naming, and potential confusion from redefined variables, you can enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code. Further, adding input validation contributes to making the code more robust and user-friendly.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary

- **Final Score**: 8.823333333333332
- **Strengths**:
  - The code passes `mypy` with no type issues.
  - `bandit` did not find any security concerns.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - `pylint` flagged several issues related to coding standards and style, which could improve code readability and maintainability.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Add Missing Docstrings**
   - **Why**: Providing documentation helps others (and future you) understand the purpose and usage of modules and functions.
   - **Action**: Use docstrings to describe what each function does, its input parameters, and its return value.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def is_prime(num):
         """Check if a number is prime.
         
         Args:
             num (int): The number to check.
         
         Returns:
             bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
         """
     ```

2. **Use Meaningful Names for Modules**
   - **Why**: A consistent naming convention makes the code more readable and easier to manage.
   - **Action**: Rename the module to conform to snake_case (e.g., `prime_counter.py`).
   - **Example**: `prime_counter.py`

3. **Prevent Variable Shadows**
   - **Why**: Redefining variables from outer scopes can lead to confusion and bugs.
   - **Action**: Avoid reusing variable names from outer contexts.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     n = int(input())  # Remove from count_primes
     def count_primes(count):
         cnt = 0
         for _ in range(count):
             num = int(input())
             if is_prime(num):
                 cnt += 1
         return cnt
     ```

4. **Handle Missing Final Newline**
   - **Why**: Following this style guideline ensures the file adheres to standard conventions.
   - **Action**: Add a newline at the end of the file.
   - **Example**: Ensure the last line is followed by a blank line.

5. **Input Handling**
   - **Why**: Input validation prevents runtime errors and makes the code more robust.
   - **Action**: Validate and sanitize inputs to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def count_primes(n):
         cnt = 0
         for _ in range(n):
             try:
                 num = int(input())
                 if is_prime(num):
                     cnt += 1
             except ValueError:
                 print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")
         return cnt
     ```

By addressing the above points, the code will not only improve in style and readability but also add robustness and maintainability.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary

**Final Score:** 7.62

**Key Strengths:**
- The code is logically correct and passes static, type, and security checks.
- The algorithm used to find the maximum difference is efficient.

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Code does not fully comply with Python style guidelines (PEP 8).
- Variable shadowing (redefining 'n' and 'r') can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Adhere to PEP 8 Style Guidelines:**
   - **Line Length:** Ensure that lines do not exceed 100 characters for better readability.
     ```python
     if n == 0:  # This line is within the 100 character limit.
         return 0
     ```
   - **Trailing Whitespace:** Remove any whitespace at the end of lines. Most modern editors can automatically trim these.
     ```python
     # Before:
     #    min_val = min(min_val, j)   
     #
     # After:
     min_val = min(min_val, j)
     ```
   - **Final Newline:** Add a newline at the end of the file. Most text editors can be configured to automatically add this.
     ```python
     # After last line:
     print(find_max_difference(n, r))
     
     ```
2. **Improve Commenting and Documentation:**
   - **Module Docstring:** Add a module-level docstring to describe the functionality provided by the file.
     ```python
     """
     This module contains a function to find the maximum difference
     between any two elements in the list where the larger element
     comes after the smaller element.
     """
     ```
3. **Refactor Naming:**
   - **Avoid Variable Shadowing:** Use more descriptive, unique names for variables to avoid shadows from outer scopes.
     ```python
     # Before:
     # n = int(input())
     # r = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
     #
     # After:
     num_elements = int(input())
     element_list = [int(input()) for _ in range(num_elements)]
     
     print(find_max_difference(num_elements, element_list))
     ```
4. **Consistent Naming Conventions:**
   - Ensure all identifiers, including the module name, follow snake_case.
     ```python
     # Rename the module to something more descriptive, e.g., `max_difference_finder.py`
     ```

### Final Code Example with Improvements

```python
"""
This module contains a function to find the maximum difference
between any two elements in the list where the larger element
comes after the smaller element.
"""

def find_max_difference(num_elements, elements):
    """
    Find the maximum difference between any two elements in the list 
    where the larger element comes after the smaller element.

    Parameters:
    num_elements (int): The number of elements in the list.
    elements (list): The list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The maximum difference found.
    """
    if num_elements == 0:
        return 0
    
    min_val = elements[0]
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    
    for j in elements[1:]:
        max_diff = max(max_diff, j - min_val)
        min_val = min(min_val, j)
    
    if max_diff == float('-inf'):
        return 0
    
    return max_diff

# Input handling
num_elements = int(input())
elements = [int(input()) for _ in range(num_elements)]

# Output the result
print(find_max_difference(num_elements, elements))
```

By applying these improvements, the code will become more reliable, readable, and maintainable.

    - Missing module docstring at line 1.
    - Module name does not conform to snake_case naming style at line 1.
    - Unused variable 'q' at line 24.
  - **Code Quality Score**: 7.06/10
  - **Summary**: The code has some formatting and stylistic issues that Pylint has flagged for improvement.

- **Tool**: Bandit
  - **Result**: No issues identified.
  - **Summary**: The code has no significant security vulnerabilities according to Bandit.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score**: 9.02
- **Key Strengths**:
  - The code is type-safe and logically functional, as verified by Mypy.
  - No critical security issues were detected by Bandit.
- **Key Weaknesses**:
  - The code has stylistic and formatting issues that could be improved to meet best practices (as flagged by Pylint).
  - The main function variable 'q' is unused and can be removed, which might indicate a logical issue if it was meant to be used.

### Actionable Tips on How to Improve the Code

1. **Address Pylint Issues**:
   - **Line Length Issues**:
     - **Description**: Line 22 is too long (102 characters when the limit is 100).
     - **Action**: Break down the line to comply with the line length limit.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())  # Original
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(  # Improved
           sort1.copy()  # Improved
       )  # Improved
       ```
   - **Missing Final Newline**:
     - **Description**: The file should end with a newline character.
     - **Action**: Add a newline character to the end of the file.
   - **Missing Module Docstring**:
     - **Description**: The module lacks a docstring at the top.
     - **Action**: Add a docstring to describe the module's purpose.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       \"\"\"
       This module provides a bubble sort implementation along with a main function to execute it.
       \"\"\"
       ```
   - **Incorrect Module Naming**:
     - **Description**: The module name should follow snake_case.
     - **Action**: Change the module name to adhere to snake_case. Note: The module name is automatically generated and you might be unable to change it directly if it is part of a package unless it's part of your project structure.
     - **Example**: If renaming is possible, change `temp_code_2ee99b03-7ab8-4185-a3fc-7d52e81921e0.py` to `bubble_sort_utils.py`.
   - **Unused Variable**:
     - **Description**: Variable 'q' is defined but never used.
     - **Action**: Remove the unused variable, as it appears to be redundant.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       # Before
       q = int(input())
       sort1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())
       print(" ".join(map(str, ary)))
       print(cnt)

       # After
       sort1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())
       print(" ".join(map(str, ary)))
       print(cnt)
       ```

2. **Code Performance Optimization** (Optional):
   - **Bubble Sort**: Although the task is to improve code quality, it's worth noting that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm. Consider using a more efficient algorithm like quicksort or mergesort for larger datasets, but this changes the algorithmic approach which seems outside this specific task’s scope.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       from typing import List, Tuple

       def quicksort(ary: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], int]:
           if len(ary) <= 1:
               return ary, 0
           pivot = ary[len(ary) // 2]
           left = [x for x in ary if x < pivot]
           middle = [x for x in ary if x == pivot]
           right = [x for x in ary if x > pivot]
           sorted_left, cnt_left = quicksort(left)
           sorted_right, cnt_right = quicksort(right)
           return sorted_left + middle + sorted_right, cnt_left + cnt_right + len(left) * len(right)
       ```

### Conclusion
By addressing these issues, the code will adhere more closely to Python coding standards, leading to better readability, maintainability, and a higher code quality score. Even small stylistic improvements can significantly enhance the overall quality of the codebase.

### Actionable Tips

#### 1. Fix Memory Issues using Valgrind
- **Definitely lost and Indirectly lost**: Ensure that all allocated memory is explicitly freed to avoid leaks.
    - Example: If allocations are made in a loop, add corresponding `free()` calls (C/C++ example).

- **Invalid Read or Write Errors**: Review the pointers and ensure they are valid before accessing or writing to them.
    - Example: Verify indices before reading/writing to arrays.
        ```java
        for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) { // Check boundary
            for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) { // Check boundary
                // No change needed here as string length is already checked
                System.out.print("#");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        ```

#### 2. Improve Code Quality with SonarQube
- **Vulnerabilities**: Identify and fix the one reported vulnerability by conducting a thorough security review.
- **Code Smells**: Address each code smell reported by SonarQube. This may involve refactoring code for better readability and performance.
    - Example: Avoid nested loops if possible, simplify complex decisions, etc.
- **Testing Coverage**: Increase code coverage by writing unit tests. SonarQube facilitates identifying untested parts.
    - Example: Write tests for various input combinations, including edge cases.

- **Comments and Documentation**: Insert necessary comments and documentation to explain complex code sections and logic.
    - Example: Comment on the intended function of the while loop and conditionals.

#### 3. Convert and Validate with Dafny for Formal Verification
- Although no code was provided for Dafny, doing so will help catch logical errors and ensure correctness.
    - Convert key logic to Dafny specifications and prove correctness.
    - Example: Define preconditions and postconditions for the main logic of your program to validate it formally.

### Conclusion
The code requires addressing memory management issues as indicated by Valgrind, improving overall quality through SonarQube recommendations, and securing the application by correcting the vulnerabilities found. Formal verification with Dafny will further enhance the reliability of your code. Implementing these steps will improve the final evaluation score significantly and ensure robust, maintainable software.

### Actionable Tips and Specific Suggestions

1. **Fix Memory Issues Identified by Valgrind**:
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
         try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
             StringTokenizer st;
             while (true) {
                 st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
                 int h = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
                 int w = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
                 if (w == 0 && h == 0) break;
                 for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
                     for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
                         if (i != 0 && i != h - 1 && j != 0 && j != w - 1) System.out.print(".");
                         else System.out.print("#");
                     }
                     System.out.println();
                 }
                 System.out.println();
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Why**: Using `try-with-resources` ensures that `BufferedReader` is closed automatically, preventing potential memory leaks.

2. **Add Comments for Code Maintainability**:
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     // Main program entry point
     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
         try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
             StringTokenizer st;
             // Loop until width and height are both 0
             while (true) {
                 st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
                 int h = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); // Height of the rectangle
                 int w = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); // Width of the rectangle
                 if (w == 0 && h == 0) break;
                 // Print rectangle with borders and inner dots
                 for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
                     for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
                         // Print dots for the interior and # for the borders
                         if (i != 0 && i != h - 1 && j != 0 && j != w - 1) System.out.print(".");
                         else System.out.print("#");
                     }
                     System.out.println();
                 }
                 System.out.println(); // Blank line after each rectangle
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Why**: Comments improve code readability and make it easier for other developers to understand the logic.

3. **Refactor and Simplify Code**:
   - **Simplify Loop Logic**:
     ```java
     for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < w; j++) {
             System.out.print((i == 0 || i == h - 1 || j == 0 || j == w - 1) ? "#" : ".");
         }
         System.out.println();
     }
     ```
   - **Why**: Simplifying the condition in the inner loop can reduce code complexity and improve readability.

4. **Enhance Security and Code Smells**:
   - **Validate Input**:
     ```java
     try {
         st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
         if (st.countTokens() != 2) {
             System.out.println("Please enter two integers for height and width.");
             continue;
         }
         int h = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
         int w = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
         if (h <= 0 || w <= 0) {
             System.out.println("Height and width must be positive integers.");
             continue;
         }
         if (w == 0 && h == 0) break;
     } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
         System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter valid integers.");
         continue;
     }
     ```
   - **Why**: Adding input validation ensures the program doesn't crash

### Actionable Tips for Improvement

#### General Code Quality:
1. **Add Comments**:
   - Example: 
     ```java
     // Reads integer input from the user
     int n = sc.nextInt();
     // Calls the calculation function and prints the result
     System.out.println(calc(n).trim());
     ```

2. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Ensure all functions and critical paths are tested. For example:
     ```java
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         assert calc(3).equals("3");
         assert isDiv(3) == true;
         assert isContain(33) == true;
         // Additional tests can further enhance coverage
     }
     ```

3. **Improve Security**:
   - Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent vulnerabilities.
   - Example (basic validation):
     ```java
     if (sc.hasNextInt()) {
         int n = sc.nextInt();
         // Proceed with processing
     } else {
         System.out.println("Invalid input");
     }
     ```

#### Memory Management:
1. **Rectify Memory Leaks**:
   - Although the provided code is in Java (where memory management is handled by garbage collection), tools like Valgrind are generally used for C/C++ code. For clean code practice:
     - Ensure all resources are properly closed and no objects are left unreferenced unintentionally.
     - Example:
       ```java
       try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
           int n = sc.nextInt();
           System.out.println(calc(n).trim());
       }
       // 'sc' is automatically closed here
       ```

#### Code Optimization:
1. **Refactor for Efficiency**:
   - Optimize loops, conditionals, and data structures for performance.
   - Example: If `isDiv` and `isContain` are frequently invoked, memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.

#### Documentation and Readability:
1. **Enhance Documentation**:
   - Provide Javadoc comments for classes and methods for better code documentation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     /**
      * Main class for processing user input and performing calculations.
      */
     public class Main {
     ```

By addressing these points, the code quality and performance can be significantly enhanced, leading to better reliability and maintainability.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code

#### 1. Formal Verification
- **Suggestion**: Implement Dafny for formal verification. Use `dafny verify Program.dfy` to verify correctness. Add preconditions and postconditions wherever necessary.
- **Example**:
    ```dafny
    method Main(args: array<string>)
    requires args.Length == 0
    ensures true
    {
        // Enter your formal specification here
    }
    ```

#### 2. Static Analysis (SonarQube)
- **Suggestion**: Address the code smells, especially lack of comments and the single detected vulnerability.
- **Example**:
    - **Comments**: Add comments to explain logic, especially complex algorithms or edge cases.
    - **Vulnerabilities**: Use static analysis tools to identify and fix specific security issues, possibly relating to handling user inputs.

#### 3. Testing Coverage (SonarQube)
- **Suggestion**: Write unit tests to cover all functionalities and increase test coverage.
- **Example**:
    ```java
    import static org.junit.Assert.*;
    import org.junit.Test;

    public class MainTest {
        @Test
        public void testMain() {
            // Add test cases to validate logic
        }
    }
    ```

#### 4. Memory Management (Valgrind)
- **Suggestion**: Fix memory leaks by ensuring all allocated memory is freed. Validate array bounds to avoid invalid reads/writes.
- **Example**:
    - **Memory Leaks**: Manually track memory allocations and ensure all are freed using `free()` in C/C++.
    - **Array Bounds**: Check indices before access:
        ```java
        if (str.equals("S") && work > 0 && work <= 13) {
            s[work - 1] = 1;
        }
        // Repeat for H, C, D...
        ```

#### 5. Input Validation
- **Suggestion**: Improve robustness by ensuring that all inputs are validated and handled properly.
- **Example**:
    - **Input Validation**: 
        ```java
        if (!str.matches("[SHCD]") || work < 1 || work > 13) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter S, H, C, or D and a number between 1 and 13.");
            continue;
        }
        ```

By addressing these issues, the code quality and performance should significantly improve, leading to a higher evaluation score.

- **Weaknesses**: Lacks test coverage, critical code smells, poor security rating due to a detected vulnerability, several memory leaks, invalid reads/writes, and lacks comments for readability.

### Actionable Tips for Improving Code Quality
1. **Improve Test Coverage**:
   - Add unit tests for different scenarios, including edge cases.
   - Examples: Create a test suite that covers all code branches and paths.

2. **Address Code Smells**:
   - Refactor the code to reduce technical debt.
   - Examples: Simplify loops or conditions that are hard to read or understand.

3. **Fix Memory Issues**:
   - Use tools like Valgrind to run the code and identify and fix leaks.
   - Examples: Use memory management techniques to ensure all allocated resources are properly released.

4. **Enhance Code Security**:
   - Address the detected vulnerability identified by SonarQube.
   - Examples: Implement input validation and handle exceptions more gracefully.

5. **Reduce Invalid Reads/Writes**:
   - Validate array and variable accesses to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
   - Examples: Use assertions to check array boundaries before access in debugging builds.

6. **Improve Code Documentation**:
   - Add comments to explain code logic and critical operations.
   - Examples: Comment blocks before significant sections of code and inline comments for complex operations.

7. **Provide a Formal Verification Approach**:
   - Translate the code logic into a formal language for verification if possible.
   - Examples: Consider rewriting critical sections in a proof assistant like Dafny if applicable.

### Example Fix

**Original Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
             PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out)) {
            int n = in.nextInt(), m = in.nextInt();
            int[][] A = new int[n][m];
            int[] b = new int[m];

            // Populate matrix A and vector b
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                    A[i][j] = in.nextInt();
                }
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                b[i] = in.nextInt();
            }

            // Perform matrix-vector multiplication
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int c = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                    c += A[i][j] * b[j];
                }
                out.println(c);

- **Vulnerability (1)**: A security vulnerability exists.
- **No comments**: The code comments density is 0%, making it harder for others to understand the intent behind the code.
- **Memory Issues**: Several memory-related issues were detected by Valgrind (definitely lost, indirectly lost, possibly lost).
- **Still Reachable Memory**: A significant amount of memory (51,760,410 bytes) is still reachable which might indicate memory leaks.
- **Invalid Read and Write Errors**: These are critical errors indicating potential out-of-bounds access.
- **Security Rating 5.0**: Although "5" is technically the best value, it might indicate that the security rating is very lenient or not strictly applied.
- **Complexity (9)**: While it's not an explicit issue, a higher complexity might mean the code is harder to understand and maintain.

### Actionable Tips

1. **Address Valgrind Issues**:
   - **Definitely Lost** and **Indirectly Lost** issues need investigation. This might mean deallocating memory that is no longer in use.
   - **Possibly Lost** memory might also be a potential leak and needs careful handling.
   - **Still Reachable** memory generally isn't an issue if the memory is still valid but not explicitly freed. However, it could indicate a larger memory footprint than expected. Further investigation is necessary.
   - **Invalid Read and Write Errors**: These are serious and must be addressed by ensuring that all memory accesses are within bounds. For example, ensure each array index is valid before accessing it.

   ```java
   // Example to prevent IndexOutOfBoundsException:
   if (i < 0 || i >= r || j < 0 || j >= c) {
       throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index is out of bounds");
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Code Smells**:
   - **Review SonarQube reports**: SonarQube should provide specific line numbers and descriptions of identified code smells. Addressing these smells can improve code quality.
   - **Example of a possible code smell**: Ensure variables are named meaningfully and that code blocks are well-structured. Here's an example of cleanup:
   
   ```java
   // Before
   for (int j = 1; j < c; j++) {
       System.out.print(" " + colSums[j]);
   }
   
   // After - more readable
   System.out.print("\nTotal column sums:");
   for (int colIndex = 1; colIndex < c; colIndex++) {
       System.out.print(" " + colSums[colIndex]);
   }
   ```

3. **Improve Security**:
   - **Fix vulnerabilities**: SonarQube and possibly other tools highlighted vulnerabilities. Understanding the nature of these vulnerabilities is critical. If they involve input validation, make sure to validate all user input properly.
   - **Example of input validation**:
   
   ```java
   // Before
   int r = scn.nextInt();
   int c = scn.nextInt();
   
   // After - validate input
   if (r <= 0 || c <= 0) {
       System.out.println("Invalid dimensions for the matrix.");
       return;
   }
   ```

4. **Improve Maintainability and Readability**:
   - **Add Comments**: Comments should provide insights into the purpose and functionality of the code. They should not repeat what the code does but rather why a certain approach is taken.
   - **Example of adding comments**:
   
   ```java
   /**
    * This method reads a matrix from standard input,
    * calculates the sums of its rows and columns,
    * and prints the matrix along with the row sums.
    */
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
       // Read matrix dimensions
       int r = scn.nextInt();
       int c = scn.nextInt();
       // ... rest of the code ...
   }
   ```
   - **Break Down Large Methods**: The `main()` method currently handles reading, processing, and displaying data. It is good practice to separate these into their own methods.

5. **Improve Code Coverage**:
   - Write unit tests and test cases to ensure the reliability of your code. Even with the current reliability rating of 1.0, comprehensive testing is necessary to catch edge cases and regressions.

In summary, addressing the memory issues through careful memory management, fixing the identified code smells, enhancing code security, adding documentation, and improving test coverage will significantly improve the quality and performance of the code.

  - *Example:* If the module is named `temp_code_d9fb53d1-5ec1-4309-b2cd-fd5524ad0ad6.py`, rename it to `temp_code_d9fb53d1_5ec1_4309_b2cd_fd5524ad0ad6.py`.

### Final Improved Code Example
```python
"""
This module provides functionality to calculate the standard deviation of a list of scores.

Functions:
- calculate_standard_deviation: Computes the standard deviation of a given list of scores.
- main: Processes user input and displays standard deviations.
"""
import math


def calculate_standard_deviation(scores):
    """Calculate the standard deviation of a list of scores."""
    ave = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    variance = sum((s - ave) ** 2 for s in scores) / len(scores)
    return math.sqrt(variance)


def main():
    """Main function to process input scores and print their standard deviations."""
    results = []
    while True:
        n = input("Enter number of scores (0 to stop): ")
        if n == '0':
            break
        scores = list(map(float, input("Enter scores separated by space: ").split()))
        alpha = calculate_standard_deviation(scores)
        results.append(alpha)

    for r in results:
        print(f"Standard Deviation: {r}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Performance

1. **Fix Pylint Issues**:
   - **Final Newline**: Add an additional empty line at the end of the file to address the missing final newline issue.
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
  
     # (Newline added here)
     ```
   - **Module Docstring**: Add a docstring at the top of the file to describe the purpose of the module.
     ```python
     """This module calculates various differences between two lists of numbers provided by the user."""
     ```
   - **Function Docstring**: Include a docstring inside the `main` function to explain its functionality.
     ```python
     def main():
         """Calculates sum of absolute differences, RMS, CRM, and max difference between two user-provided lists."""
         num = int(input())
         x = list(map(float, input().split()))
         y = list(map(float, input().split()))

         diff = [abs(x[i] - y[i]) for i in range(num)]

         # Sum of absolute differences
         print(sum(diff))

         # Root Mean Square (RMS)
         po_squared = [d * d for d in diff]
         print(math.sqrt(sum(po_squared)))

         # Cubic Root Mean (CRM)
         po_cubed = [d * d * d for d in diff]
         print((sum(po_cubed)) ** (1 / 3))

         # Maximum difference
         print(max(diff))
     ```
   - **Valid Module Name**: Rename the file with a valid Python module name in snake_case. For example, `statistics_calculator.py`.

2. **Remove Unused Imports**:
   - **Unused Import `statistics`**: Since the `statistics` library is not used, remove the import statement.
     ```python
     import math
     ```

3. **Code Refactoring (Optional Enhancements)**:
   - **List Comprehension Efficiency**: Consider breaking down list comprehensions into multiple steps or different parts of the code for readability, if needed. However, in this case, the current list comprehensions are simple enough.
   - **Modularization**: If the code were to grow or include more complex logic, consider breaking it into smaller, reusable functions.

 Addressing these issues will improve the maintainability and readability of the code, thereby enhancing its overall quality and reducing the risk of future bugs.

- **Key Strengths:**
  - Adherence to type annotations via `mypy`.
  - No security issues detected by `bandit`.
  - Clear class methods for dice operations.
- **Key Weaknesses:**
  - Code readability and formatting issues (detected by `pylint`).

### Actionable Tips for Improvement

1. **Improve Code Formatting:**
   - **Fix Line Length:** Break long lines into multiple lines to ensure they do not exceed 100 characters.
     ```python
     # Before
     self.state[0], self.state[1], self.state[5], self.state[4] = self.state[1], self.state[5], self.state[4], self.state[0]

     # After
     self.state[0], self.state[1] = self.state[1], self.state[5]
     self.state[5], self.state[4] = self.state[4], self.state[0]
     ```
   - **Final Newline:** Add a newline at the end of the file.
     ```python
     # After the last line of code
     print(dice.state[0])
     ```

2. **Add Documentation:**
   - **Module Docstring:** Add a top-level docstring describing the module's purpose.
     ```python
     """This module defines a Dice class that represents a six-faced die and provides methods to rotate the die in a 3D space."""
     ```
   - **Module Naming:** Consider renaming the module file to conform to `snake_case`, for example, `dice_operations.py`.

3. **Code Style and Best Practices:**
   - **Use `sys.exit`:** Replace calls to `exit()` with `sys.exit()` for better exit management.
     ```python
     import sys

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         try:
             # Existing code...
         except ValueError:
             print("Invalid dice values. Please enter 6 numbers separated by space.")
             sys.exit(1)
     ```

By following these suggestions, the code can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and adherence to Python best practices, which will contribute to a higher overall evaluation score in future assessments.

#### 1. Static Analysis

##### Tool: mypy
- **Output:** No issues found in 1 source file.
- **Summary:** The `mypy` static type checker did not identify any issues with the Python code. This indicates that type annotations, if present, are correct and the code conforms to type-checking standards.

##### Tool: pylint
- **Issues Found:**
  - **C0304 - Final newline missing:** There is no newline at the end of the file.
  - **C0114 - Missing module docstring:** The module lacks a description at the top.
  - **C0103 - Invalid module name:** The module name does not follow the `snake_case` naming convention. The name `temp_code_c486d16f-2102-43c9-a348-c70764a1f235` is not a valid module name.
  - **W0621 - Redefining name 'x' from outer scope:** The variable `x` is redefined in a way that shadows the name from the outer scope.

- **Summary:** `pylint` identified several minor issues related to documentation and naming conventions. While these do not affect functionality, they can impact code readability and maintainability.

##### Tool: bandit
- **Output:** No issues identified.
- **Summary:** The `bandit` security linter found no security issues in the code. This suggests that the code does not contain common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and more.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary
- **Final Score:** 8.52
- **Key Strengths:**
  - Correct type annotations as verified by `mypy`.
  - No security vulnerabilities detected by `bandit`.
  - The function `cubic` is simple and correctly implemented.

- **Key Weaknesses:**
  - Missing module documentation.
  - Invalid module name.
  - Redefinition of the variable `x`, causing shadowing issues.
  - Lack of a newline at the end of the file.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

#### Address `pylint` Issues:
1. **Final Newline:**
   - **Action:** Ensure that there is a newline at the end of the file.
   - **Example:** Before saving the file, ensure the last line is an empty line with no characters.

2. **Module Documentation:**
   - **Action:** Add a module-level docstring at the top of the file.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     """Module to calculate the cube of a given number."""
     ```

3. **Valid Module Name:**
   - **Action:** Rename the module to follow `snake_case` naming conventions.
   - **Example:** If the module is saved as a file, rename `temp_code_c486d16f-2102-43c9-a348-c70764a1f235.py` to something like `cubic_calculator.py`.

4. **Avoid Variable Redefinition:**
   - **Action:** Avoid reusing variable names that might shadow a variable in an outer scope.
   - **Example:** Rename the `x` variable inside the `try-except` block to a different name, such as `user_input`.
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         try:
             user_input = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
             ans = cubic(user_input)
             print(f"The cube of {user_input} is {ans}")
         except ValueError:
             print("Please enter a valid integer.")
     ```

#### General Code Optimization Tips:
- **Use of Docstrings:**
  - **Action:** Enhance docstrings to include more details such as error handling and expected input types.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    def cubic(x):
        """
        Calculate the cube of a given number.

        Args:
            x (int): The number to be cubed.

        Returns:
            int: The cube of the number.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the input is not a valid integer.
        """
        return x * x * x
    ```

- **Consistent Coding Style:**
  - **Action:** Follow a consistent coding style guide, such as PEP 8, to improve readability and maintainability.
  - **Example:** Ensure proper indentation, avoid unnecessary blank lines, and adhere to the guidelines for line length.

By addressing these specific issues and adhering to best practices, the code quality and performance can be significantly improved.

  - Non-PEP8-compliant module name.
  - Redefinition of variables `a` and `b` from the outer scope inside the main block, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

1. **Final Newline**:
   - **Issue**: Final newline is missing in the file.
   - **Solution**: Add a newline at the end of the file.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         a, b = map(int, input().split())
         calculate_area_and_perimeter(a, b)
     # Add newline here
     ```

2. **Module Docstring**:
   - **Issue**: No module docstring available.
   - **Solution**: Add a docstring at the top of the file to describe the module's purpose.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     """
     This module provides a function to calculate and print the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
     """
     ```

3. **Module Name**:
   - **Issue**: The module name does not follow snake_case convention.
   - **Solution**: Rename the file to a valid snake_case name, such as `rectangle_calculator.py`.

4. **Avoid Redefining Outer Scope Variables**:
   - **Issue**: Variables `a` and `b` are redefined in the main block.
   - **Solution**: Use different names for the variables in the main block.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         length, width = map(int, input().split())
         calculate_area_and_perimeter(length, width)
     ```

### Final Result Summary
- **Final Score**: 7.62
- **Key Strengths**: Type safety and security.
- **Key Weaknesses**: Style compliance and variable management.

By addressing the highlighted issues, such as improving formatting and avoiding variable redefinition, the code's quality and maintainability can be significantly enhanced.

2024-12-03 19:48:22,466 - INFO - Final output: ### Analysis Summary

#### 1. **Static Analysis**
The static analysis tools used were `mypy`, `pylint`, and `bandit`. Here's the summary of each:

- **Mypy (Type Checking):**
  - **Outcome:** No issues found.
  - **Summary:** The code passes the static type check, indicating that there are no type-related errors.

- **Pylint (Code Quality):**
  - **Outcome:** Several issues detected.
  - **Details:**
    - Missing final newline at the end of the file.
    - Missing module docstring.
    - Invalid module name due to not conforming to `snake_case`.
    - Redefining input variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` inside the function definition.
  - **Summary:** The code needs improvements in documentation and adherence to coding standards.

- **Bandit (Security Auditing):**
  - **Outcome:** No issues identified.
  - **Summary:** The code is free from security vulnerabilities according to the tool.

#### 2. **Final Evaluation Score**
- **Overall Score:** 6.67/10
- **High Points:**
  - No type errors or security vulnerabilities detected.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Lack of documentation (module docstring).
  - Non-conformant module naming.
  - Redefinition of variable names inside the function.

### Actionable Tips

To enhance the code quality and improve the final evaluation score, consider the following steps:

1. **Add a Module Docstring:**
   - **Why:** Can help other developers (including your future self) understand the purpose of the module.
   - **Action:** Add a brief description at the top of the file.
   ```python
   """This module provides a function to compare three integers and determine if they are in strictly increasing order."""
   ```

2. **Replace Invalid Module Name:**
   - **Why:** Adhering to conventions makes the codebase more readable and maintainable.
   - **Action:** Rename the file to conform to `snake_case`. For example, `compare_integers.py`.

3. **Avoid Redefinition of Input Variables:**
   - **Why:** Redefining input variables can lead to code ambiguities and unintended side effects.
   - **Action:** Change the function parameters to avoid conflict with input variables.
   ```python
   def compare(x, y, z):
       """Compares three integers to check if they are in strictly increasing order."""
       if x < y < z:
           print('Yes')
       else:
           print('No')

   # Read input from the user
   a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

   # Call the compare function
   compare(a, b, c)
   ```

4. **Ensure Final Newline in Source File:**
   - **Why:** It is a part of PEP 8 guidelines.
   - **Action:** Simply add a newline at the end of the file.
   ```python
   # End of file
   ```

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Strengths:
- The code is free from type errors and security vulnerabilities.
- The logic in the `compare` function is straightforward and easy to understand.

#### Weaknesses:
- Documentation is missing; both the module and the function could benefit from descriptive docstrings.
- The module’s name does not conform to `snake_case`, making it inconsistent with Python’s naming standards.
- Redefinition of input parameters within the function scope could lead to confusion and errors in more complex programs.

By addressing these issues, the overall quality and maintainability of the code will significantly improve, leading to a better evaluation score.

2024-12-03 19:52:51,140 - INFO - Final output: ### Summary of Analysis Results

#### 1. Static Analysis
The provided JSON includes three static analysis tools: `mypy`, `pylint`, and `bandit`.

##### a. mypy
- **Output**: `"Success: no issues found in 1 source file\n"`
- **Summary**: `mypy` reported no issues in the code, indicating that there are no type-related errors based on the provided type hints.

##### b. pylint
- **Output**: Found several issues:
  - Missing final newline (missing-final-newline)
  - Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
  - Invalid module name (invalid-name)
  - Multiple instances of redefined-outer-name warnings (e.g., `w`, `h`, `x`, `y`, `r` redefined from outer scope)
- **Summary**: The code has some style and naming conventions issues as warned by `pylint`, which can affect readability and maintainability.

##### c. bandit
- **Output**: `"No issues identified.\n"`
- **Summary**: `bandit` identified no security issues in the code indicating the script is secure from common security vulnerabilities.

### Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

#### Strengths
- The code is type-safe as verified by `mypy`.
- There are no security vulnerabilities detected by `bandit`.

#### Weaknesses
- The code has poor readability and maintainability due to the following:
  - Missing final newline and module docstring.
  - Module name does not follow the snake_case convention.
  - Variable shadowing/overwriting: Variables `w`, `h`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are being redefined from the outer scope within the function's parameter list. This practice is not recommended since it can lead to confusion.

### Actionable Tips to Improve the Code

1. **Final Newline and Docstring**:
   - **Action**: Ensure the file ends with a newline and add a module-level docstring at the top.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     """
     This module provides a utility function to determine if a point lies within a circle.
     """
     ```

2. **Module Naming**:
   - **Action**: Name the module a valid snake_case name that reflects its purpose.
   - **Example**: Rename `temp_code_45abad1d-0be3-4b81-906c-8f965acaf059` to `circle_point_checker`.

3. **Avoid Variable Redefinition**:
   - **Action**: Rename the function parameters to avoid naming conflicts.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def check_point_in_circle(rect_width, rect_height, point_x, point_y, circle_radius):
         """..."""
     ```

4. **Consistent Indentation and Formatting**:
   - **Action**: Use consistent indentation and check PEP 8 compliance.
   - **Example**: Indentation of 4 spaces is standard in Python.

### Corrected Code Example with Improvements

```python
"""
This module provides a utility function to determine if a point lies within a circle.
"""

def check_point_in_circle(rect_width, rect_height, point_x, point_y, circle_radius):
    """
    Check if the point (point_x, point_y) is within a circle of radius circle_radius 
    centered at (rect_width/2, rect_height/2).

    Parameters:
    rect_width (int): Width of the rectangle
    rect_height (int): Height of the rectangle
    point_x (int): x-coordinate of the point
    point_y (int): y-coordinate of the point
    circle_radius (int): Radius of the circle

    Returns:
    str: 'Yes' if the point is within the circle, 'No' otherwise
    """
    center_x = rect_width / 2
    center_y = rect_height / 2
    distance_squared = (point_x - center_x) ** 2 + (point_y - center_y) ** 2
    return 'Yes' if distance_squared <= circle_radius ** 2 else 'No'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rect_width, rect_height, point_x, point_y, circle_radius = map(int, input().split())
    print(check_point_in_circle(rect_width, rect_height, point_x, point_y, circle_radius))
```

### Summary of Final Evaluation
- **Final Score**: 6.67
- **Strengths**:
  - Strong type safety (mypy passed).
  - No security vulnerabilities identified (bandit passed).
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Issues with file formatting and naming conventions (pylint).

### Actionable Tips for Improvement

#### 1. Addressing Pylint Issues
- **Missing Final Newline**: Add an extra newline at the end of your file.
  ```python
  x = int(input())
  i = 1

  while x != 0:
      print(f'Case {i}: {x}')
      x = int(input())
      i += 1

  # Add an extra newline here
  ```

- **Missing Module Docstring**: Add a docstring at the beginning of the script that explains the purpose of the code.
  ```python
  """
  This module repeatedly prompts the user to enter numbers 
  and prints them with a case number in the format 'Case X: Y'.
  The loop continues until the user inputs a zero.
  """

  x = int(input())
  i = 1

  while x != 0:
      print(f'Case {i}: {x}')
      x = int(input())
      i += 1
  ```

- **Invalid Module Name**: Ensure that the filename follows the snake_case naming convention.
  - **Action**: Rename the file from `temp_code_5f5376be-0b4d-478c-97ad-06c672fe89b2.py` to a valid name like `case_printer.py`.

#### 2. General Code Quality Tips
- **Readability**: Use comments and docstrings to explain complex logic, making it easier for others (or future you) to understand the code.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs to prevent the program from crashing.
  ```python
  """
  ... (existing docstring) ...
  """

  while True:
      try:
          x = int(input("Enter a number (0 to exit): "))
          if x == 0:
              break
          print(f'Case {i}: {x}')
          i += 1
      except ValueError:
          print("Please enter a valid integer.")
  ```
- **Code Refactoring**: Break down large code blocks into functions for better organization and testing.
  ```python
  """
  ... (existing docstring) ...
  """

  def process_numbers():
      i = 1
      while True:
          try:
              x = int(input("Enter a number (0 to exit): "))
              if x == 0:
                  break
              print(f'Case {i}: {x}')
              i += 1
          except ValueError:
              print("Please enter a valid integer.")

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      process_numbers()
  ```

By addressing these issues and following these recommendations, the code will not only be more secure and maintainable but also score higher in future evaluations.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Final Newline Character**:
   - **Improvement**: Add a newline at the end of your Python files to adhere to the PEP 8 style guide.
   - **Example**: Simply add an empty line at the end of your `temp_code_889ea00e-393d-4b7b-9b5a-68d692df8bdd.py` file.

2. **Module Naming Conventions**:
   - **Improvement**: Rename the module file to follow the snake_case naming convention.
   - **Example**: Rename `temp_code_889ea00e-393d-4b7b-9b5a-68d692df8bdd.py` to `temp_code_889ea00e_393d_4b7b_9b5a_68d692df8bdd.py` or something more meaningful like `sort_pairs.py`.

3. **Function Docstring**:
   - **Improvement**: Add docstrings for the `main` function to explain its purpose, parameters, and return type.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def main():
         """
         Main function that reads pairs of integers from the input, sorts each pair in ascending order,
         and prints the sorted pairs until a pair of zeros is encountered.
         """
         results = []
         ...
     ```

### Final Thoughts

The code is already in a good state with minimal issues that can be addressed to comply with common coding standards and style guides. Implementing these improvements will enhance code readability and maintainability, and ensure it adheres to the best practices.

- The code handles invalid input gracefully by clearing the error flags and preventing infinite loops.

#### Key Weaknesses
- While the code is free from errors and warnings, there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and best practices.

### Actionable Tips on How to Improve the Code

#### Code Readability and Maintainability
**Issue:** Use of macros (`STU_NUM` and `NYUURYOKU`) can obscure the meaning of the code, especially if the codebase grows or is maintained by multiple developers.
- **Solution:** Prefer `const` or `constexpr` over `#define` for constants.
  ```cpp
  const int STU_NUM = 30;
  const int NYUURYOKU = 28;
  ```

**Issue:** The code mixes input validation and processing within a single loop, which can make it harder to read and understand.
- **Solution:** Separate input validation and processing to different parts of the code.
  ```cpp
  for(int i = 0; i < NYUURYOKU; ){
      if(!(cin >> temp)) {
          // Handle input error
      } else if (temp > 0 && temp <= STU_NUM) {
          a[temp - 1] = 1;
          ++i; // Only increment if valid input is received
      } else {
          // Handle out of range input
      }
  }
  ```

#### Best Practices
**Issue:** The code uses `using namespace std;`, which can lead to name conflicts in larger codebases.
- **Solution:** Avoid using `using namespace std;` and prefix standard library with `std::`.
  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Input out of range. Please enter a number between 1 and " << STU_NUM << "." << std::endl;
  ```

**Issue:** The array `a` could be initialized to `-1` to make it clear that values of `0` indicate unentered numbers.
- **Solution:** Modify the array initialization for clarity.
  ```cpp
  int a[STU_NUM] = {-1};
  ```

#### Example of Improved Code
Here is a refactored version of the code incorporating the suggestions:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>

const int STU_NUM = 30;
const int NYUURYOKU = 28;

int main(){
    int a[STU_NUM] = {-1};
    int temp = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < NYUURYOKU; ){
        if(!(std::cin >> temp)) { // Check for input errors
            std::cout << "Invalid input. Please try again." << std::endl;
            std::cin.clear(); // Clear the error flag
            std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n'); // Ignore the invalid input
        } else if (temp > 0 && temp <= STU_NUM) {
            a[temp - 1] = 1;
            ++i; // Only increment if valid input is received
        } else {
            std::cout << "Input out of range. Please enter a number between 1 and " << STU_NUM << "." << std::endl;
        }
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < STU_NUM; i++){
        if(a[i] == -1){
            std::cout << i + 1 << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
```

These changes should help in making the code more robust, readable, and maintainable.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

While the code score is high and there are no immediate static analysis issues, there are still potential improvements that can be made to enhance code quality and readability:

1. **Avoid `using namespace std;`**:
   - **Reason**: This practice can lead to name clashes and make it unclear which namespace functions and classes refer to.
   - **Action**: Remove or replace with specific namespaces when possible.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     // Instead of
     using namespace std;

     // Use
     std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
     ```

2. **Use `std::fill` for Initializing Arrays**:
   - **Reason**: `std::fill` provides a more readable and flexible way to initialize arrays.
   - **Action**: Replace `memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));` with `std::fill`.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     // Instead of
     memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

     // Use
     std::fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + 17 * 17, 0);
     ```

3. **Input Validation and Error Handling**:
   - **Reason**: Although not necessary in this simple example, handling input errors and extreme values can make the code more robust.
   - **Action**: Validate inputs within reasonable ranges.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     if (!(std::cin >> a >> b) || a <= 0 || b <= 0 || a > 16 || b > 16) {
         std::cerr << "Invalid input" << std::endl;
         return 1;
     }
     ```

4. **Use of Constants**:
   - **Reason**: Using constants makes the code more maintainable and prevents magic numbers.
   - **Action**: Replace fixed values like grid size (17) with named constants.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     const int GRID_SIZE = 17;
     long long dp[GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE];
     ```

5. **Code Comments**:
   - **Reason**: Adding comments can help others understand the logic and purpose of the code.
   - **Action**: Insert comments describing the purpose of loops, conditionals, and heavy logic blocks.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     // Initialize the starting point of the path
     dp[1][1] = 1;
     ```

6. **Code Separation**:
   - **Reason**: Separating concerns into functions can improve readability and maintainability.
   - **Action**: Break down the main function into smaller functions.
   - **Example**: Consider creating functions for reading input, initializing data, and computing the DP table.

### Final Note
Given the high score, we have identified some improvements for enhancing readability and robustness. However, the core functionality of the code seems to be correct, as it passes all static analysis checks without errors or warnings. Implementing the above suggestions will make the code cleaner, more maintainable, and more professional.

#### 1. Clang Tidy
- **Command**: `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_04247aa6-41c4-4738-9a86-22216e81f56a.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **Status**: Success
- **Return Code**: 0
- **Errors**: None
- **Warnings**: None
- **File**: `temp/code_files/temp_code_04247aa6-41c4-4738-9a86-22216e81f56a.cpp`

#### 2. Evaluation Score
- **Final Score**: 10
- **Static Analysis (Clang Tidy)**: 10

### Key Strengths
1. **No Errors and Warnings**: The code passed the Clang Tidy analysis with no errors or warnings, indicating that there are no obvious syntax or style issues.
2. **Correctness According to Specification**: The code correctly follows the problem's logic for finding the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` from an array of size `n`.

### Key Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement
1. **Use of Variable-Length Arrays (VLA)**: The code uses a variable-length array `int a[n];` which is not standard in C++ and can lead to undefined behavior. While allowed in some compilers as an extension, it is generally better to use standard C++ containers like `std::vector`.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The current code handles the edge case where `n < k` by outputting `-500000`, which is a placeholder. It would be better to handle such cases gracefully or ensure they don't occur as per problem constraints.
3. **Include Guards**: The code does not have include guards. Even though the includes are simple, it's a good practice to include guards to prevent redefinition problems in larger projects.
4. **Avoiding `using namespace std;`**: Using `using namespace std;` can result in name conflicts and is generally discouraged. Instead, use prefixing or namespace aliases.
5. **Magic Number**: The use of `-500000` as a placeholder is a magic number. It's better to use a named constant to clarify its meaning.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Score

#### 1. Replace VLA with `std::vector`
- **Why**: VLA is not standard C++ and can lead to undefined behavior. `std::vector` is safer and more flexible.
- **How**:
  ```cpp
  #include <vector>
  std::vector<int> a(n);
  ```
  
#### 2. Handle Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Why**: While the current placeholder works, it may not be clear to someone reading the code what the value `-500000` represents and it does not represent a proper solution for `n < k`.
- **How**:
  ```cpp
  #include <limits>
  if (n >= k) {
      int sum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
          sum += a[i];
      }
      int max_sum = sum;
      for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
          sum += a[i] - a[i - k];
          max_sum = std::max(max_sum, sum);
      }
      cout << max_sum << endl;
  } else {
      cout << "Invalid input: n should be greater than or equal to k" << endl;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Add Include Guards
- **Why**: Useful in larger projects to prevent multiple inclusion and redefinition errors.
- **How**:
  ```cpp
  #ifndef TEMP_CODE_H
  #define TEMP_CODE_H

  // code goes here

  #endif // TEMP_CODE_H
  ```

#### 4. Avoid `using namespace std;`
- **Why**: Reduces potential for conflicts with other code.
- **How**:
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <algorithm>
  int main() {
      int n, k;
      while (std::cin >> n >> k && n > 0 && k > 0) {
        std::vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          std::cin >> a[i];
        }
        if (n >= k) {
          int sum = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += a[i];
          }
          int max_sum = sum;
          for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            sum += a[i] - a[i - k];
            max_sum = std::max(max_sum, sum);
          }
          std::cout << max_sum << std::endl;
        } else {
          std::cout << "Invalid input: n should be greater than or equal to k" << std::endl;
        }
      }
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 5. Replace Magic Numbers with Constants
- **Why**: Improves code readability and maintainability.
- **How**:
  ```cpp
  const int INVALID_INPUT_INDICATOR = -500000;
  // Use INVALID_INPUT_INDICATOR in place of magic number
  ```

### Final Improved Code Example
```cpp
#ifndef TEMP_CODE_H
#define TEMP_CODE_H

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, k;
    while (cin >> n >> k && n > 0 && k > 0) {
        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        if (n >= k) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                sum += a[i];
            }
            int max_sum = sum;
            for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
                sum += a[i] - a[i - k];
                max_sum = max(max_sum, sum);
            }
            cout << max_sum << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid input: n should be greater than or equal to k" << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

#endif // TEMP_CODE_H
```

Incorporating these improvements ensures the code is more robust, maintainable, and adheres to best practices in C++.

2024-12-03 20:08:27,318 - INFO - Final output: ### Analysis Results Summary

**1. Clang Tidy:**
   - **Command Used:** `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_4c4ff7bf-3ee6-46bb-8210-99ccc9ec6fcc.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
   - **File:** `temp/code_files/temp_code_4c4ff7bf-3ee6-46bb-8210-99ccc9ec6fcc.cpp`
   - **Return Code:** 0 (Success)
   - **Errors:** None
   - **Warnings:** None
   - **Status:** Success

#### Key Strengths:
- The code passes all checks and does not violate any of the enabled rules in Clang Tidy for static analysis.
- No warnings or errors from Clang Tidy indicate that the code is syntactically correct and adheres to good practices.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
While the code is clean according to Clang Tidy, there are a few areas where it could be improved:

1. **Avoid using `<bits/stdc++.h>`:**
   - **Issue:** This header includes all standard C++ library headers which can increase compilation time and bloat the program.
   - **Solution:** Include only the necessary headers like `<iostream>`.
   - **Example:** 
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     int main() {
       for(int N; cin >> N && N > 0;) {
         int n = N, a = 0;
         // ... rest of the code ...
       }
       return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Explicitly Initialize `N` to Avoid Undefined Behavior:**
   - **Issue:** The condition in the for-loop uses an uninitialized variable `N` which could lead to undefined behavior. However, in this context, it seems to work as intended because `cin >> N` is used in the condition.
   - **Solution:** Initialize `N` to zero explicitly.
   - **Example:** 
     ```cpp
     int main() {
       int N = 0;
       for(; cin >> N && N > 0;) {
         int n = N, a = 0;
         // ... rest of the code ...
       }
       return 0;
     }
     ```

3. **Use Constants Instead of Magic Numbers:**
   - **Issue:** Magic numbers like 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, 1 are used directly in the code.
   - **Solution:** Use named constants to improve code readability and maintainability.
   - **Example:** 
     ```cpp
     const int COIN_500 = 500;
     const int COIN_100 = 100;
     const int COIN_50  = 50;
     const int COIN_10  = 10;
     const int COIN_5   = 5;
     const int COIN_1   = 1;

     int main() {
       for(int N; cin >> N && N > 0;) {
         int n = N, a = 0;
         while(n > 0) {
           if(n >= COIN_500) n -= COIN_500, a++;
           else if(n >= COIN_100) n -= COIN_100, a++;
           else if(n >= COIN_50) n -= COIN_50, a++;
           else if(n >= COIN_10) n -= COIN_10, a++;
           else if(n >= COIN_5) n -= COIN_5, a++;
           else if(n >= COIN_1) n -= COIN_1, a++;
         }
         cout << a << endl;
       }
       return 0;
     }
     ```

4. **Consider Using a Function or Algorithm for Coin Denomination Calculation:**
   - **Issue:** The calculation for the number of coins is repetitive and can be simplified.
   - **Solution:** Use a loop and an array to simplify and improve the calculation.
   - **Example:** 
     ```cpp
     const int COINS[] = {500, 100, 50, 10, 5, 1};

     int calculateCoins(int N) {
       int count = 0;
       for(int coin : COINS) {
         count += N / coin;
         N %= coin;
       }
       return count;
     }

     int main() {
       for(int N; cin >> N && N > 0;) {
         cout << calculateCoins(N) << endl;
       }
       return 0;
     }
     ```

### Final Evaluation Score Summary

2024-12-03 20:10:45,288 - INFO - Final output: ### Evaluation Summary

#### 1. Clang-Tidy Analysis:
- **Tool**: Clang-Tidy
- **Command**: `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_db89b811-43ea-4110-b085-5b379060d91c.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **Status**: Success
- **Return Code**: 0
- **Errors**: None
- **Warnings**: None

**Summary**: Clang-Tidy did not find any errors or warnings in the provided code. This suggests that the code adheres to the style guidelines and avoids known issues detected by Clang-Tidy.

#### 2. Evaluation Score Summary:
- **Final Score**: 10
- **Static Analysis Score**: 10

**Summary**: The final evaluation score is 10, with the static analysis component also scoring 10. This implies that the code has passed all static analysis checks without any issues.

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths**:
- The code has zero errors or warnings from Clang-Tidy.
- High evaluation scores indicate a clean and potentially efficient implementation.

**Weaknesses**:
- Use of macros for constants (`#define R 11` and `#define C 10010`). It's generally better to use `const` or `constexpr` for better type checking and readability.
- Lack of comments makes it harder for someone else (or even yourself, after time) to understand the logic and purpose of the code.
- Recursion in `dfs` may lead to stack overflow for larger inputs, as C++ stack size is limited. Iterative solutions or increasing stack size could mitigate this.

### Actionable Tips for Improvement
1. **Avoid Preprocessor Macros:**
   Use `const` or `constexpr` instead of macros to define constants. For example:
   ```cpp
   constexpr int R = 11;
   constexpr int C = 10010;
   ```

2. **Add Comments:**
   Include comments to explain the purpose and logic of your functions and loops. This will improve maintainability and readability:
   ```cpp
   // Flip all elements in the current row i
   void filp(int i) {
       for (int j = 0; j < c; j++)
           mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
   }
   ```

3. **Consider Iterative Solutions:**
   Replace recursive functions with iterative ones if recursion depth can become a problem. Here’s a basic example of how you might convert `dfs` to an iterative approach using stacks:
   ```cpp
   #include <stack>

   void dfs_iterative() {
       std::stack<int> s;
       s.push(0);
       while (!s.empty()) {
           int x = s.top();
           s.pop();
           if (x == r) {
               int step = 0;
               for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                   int count = 0;
                   for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
                       if (mp[i][j])
                           count++;
                   }
                   if (count < r - count) {
                       for (int i = 0; i < r; i++)
                           mp[i][j] = !mp[i][j];
                   }
               }
               for (int i = 0; i < r; i++)
                   for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                       if (mp[i][j])
                           step++;
                   }
               Max = max(step, Max);
           } else {
               s.push(x + 1); // Do not flip and proceed to next
               filp(x);      // Flip the current row
               s.push(x + 1); // Do flip and proceed to next
               filp(x);      // Flip back for other branches
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Optimize Memory Usage:**
   If possible, optimize the matrix handling to avoid excessive memory usage. This might include dynamic memory allocation for larger datasets and careful management of memory.

5. **Input Validation:**
   Add checks for invalid inputs or constraints where applicable to make the code more robust and less prone to runtime errors.

By addressing these points, you can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and performance.

2024-12-03 20:12:56,541 - INFO - Final output: ### 1. Summary of Analysis Results for Each Tool

#### Clang-Tidy
- **Command:** `clang-tidy temp/code_files/temp_code_6608c1d4-f74e-41ad-a965-fc6fc4087991.cpp --checks=*,-clang-diagnostic*-warning -- -Werror`
- **File:** `temp/code_files/temp_code_6608c1d4-f74e-41ad-a965-fc6fc4087991.cpp`
- **Return Code:** `0` (indicating success)
- **Status:** `success`
- **Errors & Warnings:** None

**Summary:**
Clang-Tidy ran successfully on the provided C++ code and found no errors or warnings. This suggests that the code adheres to the style guidelines and best practices checked by Clang-Tidy.

### 2. Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

#### Strengths:
1. **Clang-Tidy Compliance**: The code passed all checks by Clang-Tidy, indicating it follows modern C++ best practices and avoids common coding pitfalls.
2. **Clear Structure**: The code is structured in a readable manner, using meaningful variable names, standard input/output functions, and logic that is easy to follow.
3. **Final Score**: The evaluation score is perfect at **10**, highlighting a strong adherence to the criteria measured.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Variable Naming**: While variable names are understandable in the given context, using more descriptive names could enhance readability, especially for new contributors.
2. **Potential for Buffer Overflow**: The array `c[b]` is dynamically sized based on user input. If `b` is very large, this could lead to a stack overflow. Similarly, `d[1001][21]` uses a fixed size which might be too large for some cases or insufficient for others.
3. **Lack of Input Validation**: There is no check to ensure that the user input for `b` is within a safe and reasonable range before allocating large arrays on the stack.
4. **Fixed Array Size**: The array `d` is fixed in size at `1001x21`. Depending on the problem constraints, this might be inefficient or insufficient.

### 3. Specific Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Use More Descriptive Variable Names**:
   - Example: Instead of `b`, `c[]`, and `d[][]`, use `num_elements`, `elements[]`, and `dp[][]` respectively.
   - This makes the code more self-explanatory and easier to maintain.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Add checks to ensure `b` is within a reasonable range before allocating memory.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (b <= 0 || b > MAX_B_VALUE) {
         printf("Error: Please enter a valid number of elements within the range.\n");
         return 1;
     }
     ```
   - Define a macro `MAX_B_VALUE` that constrains the maximum value of `b`.

3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
   - Use `new` (or better `std::vector`) to allocate arrays dynamically, which helps avoid stack overflow issues with large inputs.
   - Example using `new`:
     ```cpp
     long long int* c = new long long int[b];
     // Use c and then delete it after use
     delete[] c;
     ```
   - Example using `std::vector`:
     ```cpp
     std::vector<long long int> c(b);
     ```

4. **Error Handling for Input Operations**:
   - Always check the result of input operations to ensure that the input is as expected.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (scanf("%lld", &b) != 1 || b <= 0) {
         printf("Error: Invalid input for the number of elements.\n");
         return 1;
     }
     ```

5. **Code Documentation and Comments**:
   - Add comments to explain the logic and purpose of key sections of the code.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     // Pre-fill the dp array to handle all possible sums from the first element
     d[0][elements[0]] = 1;
     ```

### Final Recommendations
The code is on a strong foundation with no syntax or style errors as identified by Clang-Tidy. However, enhancing input validation and using dynamic memory management will improve the robustness of the code.

- **Strengths**:
  - The code is clean and well-structured according to Clang-Tidy's standards.
  - The use of C++ standard containers (e.g., `std::vector`) is recommended where applicable, although this is not specifically checked by Clang-Tidy in this instance.

#### Evaluation Score:
- **Final Score**: `10`
- **Static Analysis**: `10`
- Overall, the code has a perfect score based on the provided static analysis.

### 3. Specific Suggestions to Fix Issues or Improve the Code

#### Clang-Tidy:
- **Use of Macros**:
  - **Issue**: The use of macros (`#define rep(i,a,b) for(int i=(a);i<(b);i++)` and `#define INF 1000000000`) is discouraged in modern C++ as they can lead to readability issues and potential bugs.
  - **Suggestion**: Replace macros with `constexpr` and inline functions.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    constexpr int INF = 1000000000;
    template<typename T>
    inline void rep(T start, T end, T& index) {
        for (index = start; index < end; ++index) {
            // operation
        }
    }
    ```

- **Avoid C-style Arrays**:
  - **Issue**: Use of fixed-size C-style arrays (`int d[51];` and `int tmp[51];`) limits the flexibility and safety of the code.
  - **Suggestion**: Use `std::vector` for dynamic arrays or `std::array` for fixed-size arrays when the size is known at compile time.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    std::vector<int> d(n);
    std::vector<int> tmp(c);
    ```

- **Magic Numbers**:
  - **Issue**: The number `51` in `int d[51];` and `int tmp[51];` is a magic number, which can make the code less readable and maintainable.
  - **Suggestion**: Use named constants or `enum` class to provide meaningful names to these values.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    constexpr int MAX_ARRAY_SIZE = 51;
    std::vector<int> d(MAX_ARRAY_SIZE);
    std::vector<int> tmp(c);
    ```

- **Use of `using namespace std;`**:
  - **Issue**: The statement `using namespace std;` is generally discouraged as it can lead to name conflicts and reduce code clarity.
  - **Suggestion**: Remove the `using namespace std;` and prefix standard library names with `std::`.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    int main() {
      int n, r;
      while (1) {
        std::cin >> n >> r;
        // remaining code
      }
      return 0;
    }
    ```

### Final Thoughts
The code provided is generally good, but there are opportunities for improvement in terms of readability, flexibility, and modern C++ practices. By following the suggestions above, the code can be enhanced in these areas.

### Actionable Tips for Improving Code Quality

Despite the perfect score from Clang-Tidy, there are still areas where code clarity, efficiency, and robustness can be improved:

1. **Avoid `using namespace std;`:**
   - **Issue:** Including all names in the `std` namespace can lead to name collisions and reduce code readability.
   - **Solution:** Remove `using namespace std;` and use the `std::` prefix when necessary.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     // #include <iostream>
     // #include <string>
     // using namespace std;
     
     #include <iostream>
     #include <string>
     
     // ...
     
     std::string line[33];
     int w, h, x, y, sum;
     
     void countup(int x, int y) {
         if (y < 0 || y >= h || x < 0 || x >= w) return; // Boundary checks
         if (line[y][x] != '#') {
             line[y][x] = '#';
             countup(x, y - 1);
             countup(x, y + 1);
             countup(x + 1, y);
             countup(x - 1, y);
             sum++;
         }
     }
     
     int main() {
         while (std::cin >> w >> h) {
             if (!w && !h) break;
             sum = 0;
             for (int i = 1; i <= h; i++) {
                 std::cin >> line[i];
                 line[i] = "#" + line[i] + "#"; // Padding with '#'
                 for (int j = 1; j <= w; j++) {
                     if (line[i][j] == '@') {
                         x = j;
                         y = i;
                     }
                 }
             }
             line[0] = line[h + 1] = std::string(w + 2, '#'); // Top and bottom borders
             countup(x, y);
             std::cout << sum << std::endl;
         }
         return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Use `std::vector` for Dynamic Sizing:**
   - **Issue:** The array `line` has a fixed size, which can lead to problems if the input size exceeds the array's bounds.
   - **Solution:** Use `std::vector` to dynamically allocate the required number of elements based on the input.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <string>
     #include <vector>

     int w, h, x, y, sum;

     void countup(int x, int y, std::vector<std::string>& line) {
         if (y < 0 || y >= h || x < 0 || x >= w) return; // Boundary checks
         if (line[y][x] != '#') {
             line[y][x] = '#';
             countup(x, y - 1, line);
             countup(x, y + 1, line);
             countup(x + 1, y, line);
             countup(x - 1, y, line);
             sum++;
         }
     }

     int main() {
         while (std::cin >> w >> h) {
             if (!w && !h) break;
             sum = 0;
             std::vector<std::string> line(h + 2, std::string(w + 2, '#')); // Initialize with borders
             for (int i = 1; i <= h; i++) {
                 std::cin >> line[i];
                 line[i] = "#" + line[i] + "#"; // Padding with '#'
                 for (int j = 1; j <= w; j++) {
                     if (line[i][j] == '@') {
                         x = j;
                         y = i;
                     }
                 }
             }
             countup(x, y, line);
             std::cout << sum << std::endl;
         }
         return 0;
     }
     ```

3. **Input Validation:**
   - **Issue:** The code trusts that the input will be valid without additional checks.
   - **Solution:** Add checks for invalid inputs to ensure robustness.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     if (!(std::cin >> w >> h)) {
         std::cerr << "Failed to read width and height." << std::endl;
         return 1;
     }
     if (w <= 0 || h <= 0) {
         std::cerr << "Width and height must be positive." << std::endl;
         return 1;
     }
     ```

4. **Code Readability:**
   - **Issue:** The code can benefit from additional comments and better variable naming for easier understanding.
   - **Solution:** Add meaningful comments and consider renaming variables if they are unclear.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     // Main function to process multiple test cases
     int main() {
         // Loop until width and height are both zero
         while (std::cin >> width >> height) {
             if (!width && !height) break;
             sum = 0;
             
             // Initialize the grid with borders
             std::vector<std::string> grid(height + 2, std::string(width + 2, '#'));

             // Fill the grid with input data and find the starting '@'
             for (int row = 1; row <= height; row++) {
                 if (!(std::cin >> grid[row])) {
                     std::cerr << "Failed to read line " << row << "." << std::endl;
                     return 1;
                 }
                 grid[row] = "#" + grid[row] + "#"; // Add padding

                 for (int col = 1; col <= width; col++) {
                     if (grid[row][col] == '@') {
                         startX = col;
                         startY = row;
                     }
                 }
             }

             // Count the connected '#'s starting from the found '@'
             countup(startX, startY, grid);
             std::cout << sum << std::endl;
         }
         return

- **File analyzed:** `temp/code_files/temp_code_96bb3c8e-9341-4b07-ae34-6d8d984ede71.cpp`
- **Return Code:** `0` (success)
- **Status:** success
- **Errors:** None
- **Warnings:** None

### Evaluation Score Summary

- **Final Score:** `10`
- **Static Analysis (Clang-Tidy):** `10`

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses

#### **Strengths:**
- **Clang-Tidy:** 
  - The code passed the static analysis without any errors or warnings.
  - This suggests that the code adheres to the conventions and quality standards enforced by Clang-Tidy.

#### **Weaknesses:**
- While the code passed Clang-Tidy, there might be some potential improvements in terms of readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- Use of macros can obscure the code, making it less readable.
- Magic numbers and hard-coded values are used directly in the code, which could be error-prone.
- The code does not include comments or documentation, which could be helpful for anyone reading or maintaining the code.

### Actionable Tips to Improve the Code

#### **Readability and Maintainability:**
- **Use of Macros**: Replace macros with `const` or `constexpr` variables to improve readability and reduce potential errors.
- **Magic Numbers**: Define symbolic constants for numeric literals (e.g., `1000`, `100`, `10`, `1`).
- **Comments and Documentation**: Add comments explaining the purpose of functions, significant code blocks, and any algorithmic logic.
- **Break Down Functions**: Break down large functions like `encrypt` and `decrypt` into smaller, more manageable functions if possible.

#### **Best Practices:**
- **Include Headers Selectively**: Instead of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, include only the necessary standard headers (e.g., `#include <iostream>`).
- **Avoid `using namespace std;`**: Explicitly use `std::` prefix for standard library entities to avoid potential name conflicts and improve code clarity.
- **String Parsing and Error Handling**: Improve string parsing to handle edge cases and possible malformed input. Consider using more robust parsing techniques or libraries if needed.
  
#### **Example of Improved Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

const int THOUSAND = 1000;
const int HUNDRED = 100;
const int TEN = 10;

// Function to encrypt a number into a string representation
string encrypt(int n) {
    int m = n / THOUSAND;
    n %= THOUSAND;
    int c = n / HUNDRED;
    n %= HUNDRED;
    int x = n / TEN;
    int i = n % TEN;

    string res;

    if (m > 0) {
        if (m != 1) res += std::to_string(m);
        res += "m";
    }

    if (c > 0) {
        if (c != 1) res += std::to_string(c);
        res += "c";
    }

    if (x > 0) {
        if (x != 1) res += std::to_string(x);
        res += "x";
    }

    if (i > 0) {
        if (i != 1) res += std::to_string(i);
        res += "i";
    }

    return res;
}

// Function to decrypt a string representation back to a number
int decrypt(const string &s) {
    int res = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        char unit = s[i];
        if (unit == 'm' || unit == 'c' || unit == 'x' || unit == 'i') {
            int multiplier = (unit == 'm') ? THOUSAND : (unit == 'c') ? HUNDRED : (unit == 'x') ? TEN : 1;
            if (i == 0 || !isdigit(s[i - 1])) {
                res += multiplier;
            } else {
                size_t start = 0;
                while (start < i && isdigit(s[start])) start++;
                res += multiplier * std::stoi(s.substr(start, i - start));
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    cin.sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        string s1, s2;
        cin >> s1 >> s2;
        cout << encrypt(decrypt(s1) + decrypt(s2)) << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation of Changes:**
- **Include Headers Selectively:** Only include necessary headers.
- **Use of `const` or `constexpr`:** Replaced macros with `const` or `constexpr` variables.
- **Comments:** Added comments for better readability.
- **String Parsing:** Improved string parsing to handle cases where the number could be missing before the unit specifier.
- **Explicit `using` Directives:** Used `using std::...` for clarity.

These changes aim to make the code more readable, maintainable, and robust.

- **Final Score:** 10

### Key Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths:**
  - The code passed all static analysis checks performed by Clang-Tidy, indicating no detected syntax errors, undefined behavior, or other issues that could cause runtime errors.
  - The code successfully uses standard libraries and algorithms, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers efficiently.
  
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Missing runtime memory analysis (Valgrind), potentially hiding memory-related issues such as leaks or overflows.
  - Absence of formal verification results, which could confirm the correctness of the logic or provide insights into specific invariants.
  - Code readability and potential pitfalls due to the way the Sieve of Eratosthenes is implemented.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Fix Syntax Error in Prime Calculation:**
   - **Issue:** There is a syntax error in the `prime_set` function in the nested for loop increment statement.
     ```cpp
     for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++)++)  // Incorrect: there is a double '++'
     ```
   - **Fix:** Remove the extra `+` so that the loop correctly increments `i`.
     ```cpp
     for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i)
     ```

2. **Check for Overflow in Integer Handling:**
   - **Issue:** The code calculates sums that could overflow when `a` and `b` are large.
   - **Fix:** Consider using a larger integer type (e.g., `long long`) if the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are large and might exceed the range of `int`.
     ```cpp
     int solve(int a, int b, int n){  // Change to long long if needed
     ```

3. **Add Error Checking for Input:**
   - **Improvement:** Ensure input values are checked for validity (e.g., non-negative, within expected range) to prevent undefined behavior.
     ```cpp
     while(cin >> a >> b >> n && a >= 0 && b >= 0 && n >= 0 && a != 0 && b != 0 && n != 0){
     ```

4. **Code Readability and Maintenance:**
   - **Improvement:** Improve code readability by adding comments and proper spacing.
     ```cpp
     for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
       if(prime[i]) {
         for(int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
           prime[j] = false;
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Improvement:** Consider encapsulating functionality into smaller functions to improve maintainability and readability.
     ```cpp
     void prime_set(int n) {
       // Initialize prime vector
       prime.resize(n + 1, true);
       prime[0] = prime[1] = false;
       
       // Sieve of Eratosthenes
       for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
         if(prime[i]) {
           for(int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
             prime[j] = false;
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

5. **Optional - Include Runtime and Formal Verification Checks:**
   - **Improvement:** If possible, include Valgrind and formal verification tools to check for memory leaks, out-of-bounds errors, and logical correctness, respectively.
   - **Example Valgrind Command:**
     ```bash
     valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./program_name
     ```

By addressing these points, the code will be safer, more readable, and maintainable. Running additional tools like Valgrind and formal verification can provide further insights into the robustness and correctness of the code.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Score

1. **Increase Code Complexity**: Add more functionality to the code to see if Clang-Tidy can catch more issues. This could include functions, loops, array handling, etc.
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>

   void greetUsers(const std::vector<std::string>& users) {
       for (const auto& user : users) {
           std::cout << "Hello, " << user << "!" << std::endl;
       }
   }

   int main() {
       std::vector<std::string> users = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
       greetUsers(users);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Test for Resource Management and Memory Safety**: Introduce scenarios where memory management and resource handling would be evaluated.
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <memory>

   void processResource(std::unique_ptr<int> resource) {
       if (resource) {
           std::cout << "Resource value: " << *resource << std::endl;
       }
   }

   int main() {
       std::unique_ptr<int> resource = std::make_unique<int>(42);
       processResource(std::move(resource)); // Resource is now owned by processResource
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Review Advanced Code Constructs**: Start using complex C++ features and ensure that they are implemented correctly. This can reveal subtle issues STATIC analysis might catch.
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <type_traits>

   template <typename T>
   void printIfIntegral(const T& value) {
       if constexpr (std::is_integral_v<T>) {
           std::cout << "Integral value: " << value << std::endl;
       } else {
           std::cout << "Non-integral value." << std::endl;
       }
   }

   int main() {
       printIfIntegral(42);    // Integral value
       printIfIntegral("Hi");  // Non-integral value
       return 0;
   }
   ```

4. **Expand Test Coverage**: By adding more test cases and code variations, you can catch a wider range of potential issues.
   - For example, add boundary conditions, null checks, and data validation in more complex functions.

### Conclusion
The initial code has demonstrated exceptional adherence to static analysis standards, as identified by Clang-Tidy. However, to maintain or further enhance code quality, introducing more complex and varied code snippets is recommended. This practice will help identify additional areas for improvement and refactoring.

- **Graceful Degradation and Robustness**: As the application grows, consider incorporating more complex test cases and use Clang-Tidy to catch issues early.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Although the code is simple and easy to understand, ensure that as functionality increases, comments and documentation are adequately provided.

#### 2. Valgrind (Memory Tool)
Even though Valgrind results are not provided, it is crucial to use it for more complex applications to hunt for memory leaks, invalid memory access, and other memory management issues:
- **Example**: Running Valgrind on a more complex code might look like this:
  ```
  valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./your_program
  ```
- **Tips**: Always initialize pointers and variables, use smart pointers in C++ to manage memory automatically, and free allocated memory properly.

#### 3. Formal Verification
Formal verification is effective for proving the correctness of certain aspects of the code:
- **Example**: Use tools like SPARK or Microsoft Boogie, especially if the code involves critical calculations or security-sensitive operations.
- **Tips**: Consider formal verification especially for critical components where bugs can have severe consequences.

#### 4. RankMe
RankMe is presumably a code quality assessment tool, though results are not available:
- **Tips**: Aim for higher readability, maintainability, and simplicity in the code. Writing modular and unit-tested code can significantly improve the quality and reduce maintenance time.

### Conclusion
The provided code snippet has achieved a perfect static analysis score. However, as the project scales, it is crucial to integrate memory management tools like Valgrind and potentially adopt formal verification techniques for critical components to maintain the high quality and reliability of the code. Always strive to write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.

### Actionable Tips to Improve the Code Quality and Score

**1. Increase Code Complexity:**
   - Introduce more complex logic to test the static analysis tool's capabilities.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <string>
     #include <vector>

     void printStrings(const std::vector<std::string>& strings) {
         for (const auto& str : strings) {
             std::cout << str << std::endl;
         }
     }

     int main() {
         std::vector<std::string> greetings = {"Hello, World!", "Welcome!", "Enjoy coding!"};
         printStrings(greetings);
         return 0;
     }
     ```

**2. Add Comments and Documentation:**
   - Improve code readability by adding comments and documentation.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <string>
     #include <vector>

     /**
      * Prints each string in the provided vector to the console.
      *
      * @param strings A vector of strings to be printed.
      */
     void printStrings(const std::vector<std::string>& strings) {
         for (const auto& str : strings) {
             std::cout << str << std::endl;
         }
     }

     /**
      * Main function to demonstrate printing strings.
      */
     int main() {
         std::vector<std::string> greetings = {"Hello, World!", "Welcome!", "Enjoy coding!"};
         printStrings(greetings);
         return 0;
     }
     ```

**3. Test with Additional Tools:**
   - Introduce more comprehensive testing tools like Valgrind for memory usage, and formal verification for more rigorous correctness checks.
   - **Example Command for Valgrind:**
     ```
     valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./your_program
     ```

**4. Implement Error Handling:**
   - Although not necessary in this simple example, adding error handling in more complex programs can prevent issues and increase robustness.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <string>
     #include <vector>

     void printStrings(const std::vector<std::string>& strings) {
         if (strings.empty()) {
             std::cerr << "Error: No strings to print." << std::endl;
             return;
         }
         for (const auto& str : strings) {
             std::cout << str << std::endl;
         }
     }

     int main() {
         std::vector<std::string> greetings;
         printStrings(greetings);
         return 0;
     }
     ```

### Conclusion
The provided code snippet is clean and flawless according to the current evaluation. However, expanding its complexity and adding robust practices like documentation, error handling, and using a wider range of testing tools will help maintain its high quality and identify potential issues in more extensive codebases.

2024-12-04 16:07:09,190 - INFO - Final output: ### Evaluation Summary

**1. Static Analysis:**
The static analysis tool failed to produce a valid score, which suggests that there might be an issue with the tool or the way the code was analyzed. However, we can still manually inspect the code for potential static analysis warnings or errors that might be identified. 

*Key Issues:*
- `stsatic_analysis` is misspelled. This might indicate a typo in the configuration or the tool name.
- There is a lack of proper resource management, specifically the `BufferedReader` is not being closed. This can lead to resource leaks.
- Minor formatting and best practices concerns.

*Key Strengths:*
- Effective error handling for `NumberFormatException` and `IOException`.
- Use of `Arrays.sort()` for finding the top 3 elements.

**2. Valgrind:**
Valgrind is typically used for memory and resource management in C/C++ and similar languages. Since the provided code is in Java, Valgrind might not be directly applicable without modification to the environment or translating the code to a C/C++ equivalent. However, based on the known issues in Java, the same types of tools (like Eclipse Memory Analyzer) would flag these issues.

*Key Issues:*
- Missing resource management (closing of `BufferedReader`).

**3. Formal Verification:**
Formal verification tools are used to prove the correctness of a program based on a formal specification. These tools are typically more complex and are not as commonly used on small, iterative projects. However, with the given code, formal verification would likely flag issues around runtime exceptions and incomplete handling of edge cases.

*Key Issues:*
- Lack of handling for less than 3 inputs which could occur in cases where the user forcibly terminates mid-input.
- Incorrect indexing assumptions when printing the top 3 elements (though the code is correct for this common case).

**4. RankMe:**
RankMe typically refers to a ranking system or metric for evaluating different design patterns or code quality metrics. Its score is not available in this context, and it’s generally not common in standard code analysis reports.

*Key Issues:*
- No specific issues identified without further context on what RankMe evaluates.
- Code could benefit from methods that improve readability and maintainability.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary

**Highlights of Key Issues:**
- **Resource Management:** Not closing `BufferedReader` leads to potential resource leaks.
- **Fault Handling:** While `NumberFormatException` and `IOException` are caught, there are no validations for cases where fewer than 3 valid integers are received.
- **Best Practices:** Improvements in code structure, readability, and extraction of complex tasks into methods would enhance the maintainability of the code.

**Key Strengths:**
- Effective error handling for input errors.
- Utilization of Java's standard library for sorting and improving efficiency.

### Actionable Tips

**1. Close Resources Properly:**
*Action:* Use try-with-resources statement to ensure that `BufferedReader` is closed after use.
*Example:*
```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
    // existing code
}
```

**2. Handle Edge Cases:**
*Action:* Add checks to handle cases where fewer than 3 valid inputs are provided.
*Example:*
```java
if (height.length < 3) {
    System.out.println("Not enough valid inputs provided. Please provide at least 3 integers.");
    return;
}
```

**3. Improve Readability:**
*Action:* Extract complex logic into separate methods to improve code readability and reduce repetition.
*Example:*
```java
public static int[] readHeights(BufferedReader br) throws IOException {
    int[] heights = new int[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
        try {
            heights[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.");
            i--; // Decrement i to re-prompt for the same index
        }
    }
    return heights;
}

public static int[] getTopThree(int[] array) {
    Arrays.sort(array);
    int[] topThree = new int[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        topThree[i] = array[array.length - i - 1];
    }
    return topThree;
}
```

**4. Fix Typographical Errors:**
*Action:* Correct typographical errors in the tool names or configuration files.
*Example:* Change `stsatic_analysis` to `static_analysis`.

By addressing these points, the code can become more robust, maintainable, and efficient.

### Highlights of Key Issues or Strengths

#### Strengths:
- **Reliability Rating**: 1 out of 5 indicates high reliability.
- **Duplicated Lines Density**: 0%, suggesting no duplicated code.
- **Duplicated Blocks**: 0, indicating no duplicated blocks.
- **Code Smells**: 0, meaning there are no code smells.
- **Bugs**: 0, indicating the code does not contain any bugs.

#### Weaknesses:
- **Vulnerabilities**: 1 detected by SonarQube.
- **Security Rating**: 5.0, which is the worst possible score on SonarQube; it indicates high security risk.
- **No Comments**: The code has no comment lines, which is a good practice for small single-function programs but generally helpful for more complex programs to maintain readability.
- **Line Coverage**: 0%, suggesting that a dynamic analysis (if available) would show that no part of the code has been tested, possibly due to lack of unit tests.
- **Coverage**: 0%, similar to line coverage, the overall coverage is low.
- **No Formal Verification**: Could not verify code correctness via formal methods.
- **No Dynamic Analysis**: Dynamic analysis results were not available.
- **Single Function and Class Absence**: The program has only one function and no class definitions, which may limit its utility for more complex scenarios.

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality

1. **Add Comments Where Appropriate**:
   - **Action**: Add comments to the code to explain the purpose and functionality.
   - **Example**:
     ```go
     package main

     import (
         "fmt"
     )

     // main prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
     func main() {
         fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
     }
     ```

2. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - **Action**: Create unit tests to check the functionality of the code and increase the coverage.
   - **Example (using Go’s testing package)**:
     ```go
     // test_main_test.go
     package main

     import "testing"

     // TestMain verifies the main function's output.
     func TestMain(t *testing.T) {
         result := captureOutput(func() {
             main()
         })
         if result != "Hello, World!\n" {
             t.Errorf("Expected 'Hello, World!\n', got '%s'", result)
         }
     }

     // captureOutput is a helper function to capture the output of the main function.
     func captureOutput(f func()) string {
         old := os.Stdout
         output := new(bytes.Buffer)
         os.Stdout = output
         defer func() { os.Stdout = old }()
         f()
         return output.String()
     }
     ```
   - **Note**: You may need additional packages (`os`, `bytes`) for capturing the output of the program.

3. **Address Vulnerabilities and Security Concerns**:
   - **Action**: Perform a manual security review of the code to understand and mitigate the security vulnerability pointed out by SonarQube.
   - **Action**: Use security-focused tools to identify patterns and correct them.

4. **Formal Verification with Dafny**:
   - **Action**: Write specifications for the function if using formal verification tools like Dafny.
   - **Action**: Provide full source code compatible with the formal verification tool.
   - **Example**: Reimplement in Dafny language if needed.
     ```dafny
     method Main() {
       print("Hello, World!")
     }
     ```
   - **Note**: This is a very simple example which usually formal verification would be more useful in programs with complex mathematical computations or concurrency.

5. **Enhance Code Maintainability with Classes (for larger programs)**:
   - **Action**: If the program expands, consider using classes to organize code better.
   - **Note**: Not directly applicable to the current example as it’s a simple "Hello, World!" program.

     package main

     import (
         "testing"
     )

     func TestMain(t *testing.T) {
         // Ideally test cases would be more extensive.
         if false {
             t.Errorf("Expected some condition true, got false")
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Address the Detected Vulnerability:**
   - **Why?** Critical for maintaining the security of the application.
   - **How?** Review the vulnerability reported by Sonarqube and make necessary changes.
   - **Example:** Ensure that any input handling, API usage, or other security-relevant parts of the code are properly secured.

4. **Incorporate More Tools for Analysis:**
   - **Why?** Using a variety of tools can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and catch issues missed by other tools.
   - **How?** Integrate Valgrind for memory-related issues, formal verification for correctness proofs, and dynamic analysis for runtime issues.
   
5. **Maintain a Reliability Score:**
   - **Why?** Reliability is critical for production-ready code.
   - **How?** Continue to ensure the absence of bugs and maintain a high reliability score.

6. **Code Review and Refactoring:**
   - **Why?** Helps catch issues early and ensures adherence to best practices.
   - **How?** Perform regular code reviews and refactor code as necessary.
   - **Example:** As the code grows, ensure it remains modular and structured.

By implementing these suggestions, the codebase can be significantly improved in terms of quality, maintainability, and security.

### Key Evaluation Score Summary

- **Final Evaluation Score**: 9.07 / 10
- **Tool Scores**:
  - **Static Analysis**: 9.07 / 10 (mypy: 10/10, pylint: 7.22/10, bandit: 10/10)

### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Performance

#### Fixing Style Issues (pylint)
1. **Line Length**:
   - **Issue**: Lines 6 and 18 exceed the maximum allowed length of 100 characters.
   - **Action**: Break down long lines into shorter, more readable ones. 
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     prompt = "Enter two non-negative integers separated by space: "
     a, b = map(int, input(prompt).split())
     ```

2. **Final Newline**:
   - **Issue**: The file does not end with a newline.
   - **Action**: Add a newline at the end of the file.
   - **Example**: Ensure the last line of the file ends with an empty line.

3. **Module Docstring**:
   - **Issue**: The module is missing a docstring.
   - **Action**: Add a docstring at the beginning of the module to describe its purpose.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     """
     Module for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM)
     of two non-negative integers entered by the user.
     """
     ```

4. **Module Naming**:
   - **Issue**: The module name does not follow the `snake_case` naming style.
   - **Action**: Rename the module to a `snake_case` compliant name.
   - **Example**: If the module file is named `gcd_lcm_calculator.py`, it adheres to the naming convention.

#### Additional Suggestions

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that the user receives clear feedback on what constitutes valid input and what not.
   - Enhance validation checks if additional constraints are required (e.g., range limits).

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Break down the main function into smaller, more manageable functions. Each function should have a single responsibility, enhancing readability and testability.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def get_inputs():
         """Gets two non-negative integer inputs from the user."""
         while True:
             try:
                 a, b = map(int, input("Enter two non-negative integers separated by space: ").split())
                 if a < 0 or b < 0:
                     print("Error: Inputs must be non-negative.")
                 else:
                     return a, b
             except ValueError:
                 print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter two non-negative integers separated by space.")
             except KeyboardInterrupt:
                 print("\nProgram terminated by user.")
                 return None, None

     def main():
         """Main function to run the GCD and LCM calculator."""
         print("GCD and LCM Calculator")
         while True:
             a, b = get_inputs()
             if a is None or b is None:
                 break
             gcd = math.gcd(a, b)
             lcm = int(a * b / gcd)
             print(f"GCD: {gcd}, LCM: {lcm}")
     ```

3. **Code Commenting and Documentation**:
   - Add inline comments to critical sections of the code to improve readability and maintainability.
   - Document functions and methods with docstrings to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values.

By addressing these points, the code will become more robust, readable, and maintainable, leading to fewer errors and easier future modifications.
