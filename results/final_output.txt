### Actionable Tips to Improve Code Quality and Performance

#### Fixing Style Issues (pylint)
1. **Line Length**:
   - **Issue**: Lines 6 and 18 exceed the maximum allowed length of 100 characters.
   - **Action**: Break down long lines into shorter, more readable ones. 
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     prompt = "Enter two non-negative integers separated by space: "
     a, b = map(int, input(prompt).split())
     ```

2. **Final Newline**:
   - **Issue**: The file does not end with a newline.
   - **Action**: Add a newline at the end of the file.
   - **Example**: Ensure the last line of the file ends with an empty line.

3. **Module Docstring**:
   - **Issue**: The module is missing a docstring.
   - **Action**: Add a docstring at the beginning of the module to describe its purpose.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     """
     Module for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM)
     of two non-negative integers entered by the user.
     """
     ```

4. **Module Naming**:
   - **Issue**: The module name does not follow the `snake_case` naming style.
   - **Action**: Rename the module to a `snake_case` compliant name.
   - **Example**: If the module file is named `gcd_lcm_calculator.py`, it adheres to the naming convention.

#### Additional Suggestions

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that the user receives clear feedback on what constitutes valid input and what not.
   - Enhance validation checks if additional constraints are required (e.g., range limits).

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Break down the main function into smaller, more manageable functions. Each function should have a single responsibility, enhancing readability and testability.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def get_inputs():
         """Gets two non-negative integer inputs from the user."""
         while True:
             try:
                 a, b = map(int, input("Enter two non-negative integers separated by space: ").split())
                 if a < 0 or b < 0:
                     print("Error: Inputs must be non-negative.")
                 else:
                     return a, b
             except ValueError:
                 print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter two non-negative integers separated by space.")
             except KeyboardInterrupt:
                 print("\nProgram terminated by user.")
                 return None, None

     def main():
         """Main function to run the GCD and LCM calculator."""
         print("GCD and LCM Calculator")
         while True:
             a, b = get_inputs()
             if a is None or b is None:
                 break
             gcd = math.gcd(a, b)
             lcm = int(a * b / gcd)
             print(f"GCD: {gcd}, LCM: {lcm}")
     ```

3. **Code Commenting and Documentation**:
   - Add inline comments to critical sections of the code to improve readability and maintainability.
   - Document functions and methods with docstrings to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values.

By addressing these points, the code will become more robust, readable, and maintainable, leading to fewer errors and easier future modifications.
