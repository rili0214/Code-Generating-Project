### Actionable Tips on How to Improve the Code

1. **Address Pylint Issues**:
   - **Line Length Issues**:
     - **Description**: Line 22 is too long (102 characters when the limit is 100).
     - **Action**: Break down the line to comply with the line length limit.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())  # Original
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(  # Improved
           sort1.copy()  # Improved
       )  # Improved
       ```
   - **Missing Final Newline**:
     - **Description**: The file should end with a newline character.
     - **Action**: Add a newline character to the end of the file.
   - **Missing Module Docstring**:
     - **Description**: The module lacks a docstring at the top.
     - **Action**: Add a docstring to describe the module's purpose.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       \"\"\"
       This module provides a bubble sort implementation along with a main function to execute it.
       \"\"\"
       ```
   - **Incorrect Module Naming**:
     - **Description**: The module name should follow snake_case.
     - **Action**: Change the module name to adhere to snake_case. Note: The module name is automatically generated and you might be unable to change it directly if it is part of a package unless it's part of your project structure.
     - **Example**: If renaming is possible, change `temp_code_2ee99b03-7ab8-4185-a3fc-7d52e81921e0.py` to `bubble_sort_utils.py`.
   - **Unused Variable**:
     - **Description**: Variable 'q' is defined but never used.
     - **Action**: Remove the unused variable, as it appears to be redundant.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       # Before
       q = int(input())
       sort1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())
       print(" ".join(map(str, ary)))
       print(cnt)

       # After
       sort1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
       ary, cnt = bubblesort(sort1.copy())
       print(" ".join(map(str, ary)))
       print(cnt)
       ```

2. **Code Performance Optimization** (Optional):
   - **Bubble Sort**: Although the task is to improve code quality, it's worth noting that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm. Consider using a more efficient algorithm like quicksort or mergesort for larger datasets, but this changes the algorithmic approach which seems outside this specific taskâ€™s scope.
     - **Example**:
       ```python
       from typing import List, Tuple

       def quicksort(ary: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], int]:
           if len(ary) <= 1:
               return ary, 0
           pivot = ary[len(ary) // 2]
           left = [x for x in ary if x < pivot]
           middle = [x for x in ary if x == pivot]
           right = [x for x in ary if x > pivot]
           sorted_left, cnt_left = quicksort(left)
           sorted_right, cnt_right = quicksort(right)
           return sorted_left + middle + sorted_right, cnt_left + cnt_right + len(left) * len(right)
       ```

### Conclusion
By addressing these issues, the code will adhere more closely to Python coding standards, leading to better readability, maintainability, and a higher code quality score. Even small stylistic improvements can significantly enhance the overall quality of the codebase.
