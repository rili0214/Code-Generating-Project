     - **Indirectly Lost:** 0
     - **Still Reachable:** 0
     - **Uninitialized Value Errors:** 0
     - **Invalid Write Errors:** 0
     - **Invalid Read Errors:** 0
   - **Summary:** Valgrind did not report any memory leaks or invalid memory access issues in the code.

#### 4. **RankMe:**
   - **Score:** 2.828427124746189 / 10
   - **Summary:** The RankMe score suggests there might be opportunities for improvement in terms of code quality metrics but does not provide specific issues with the code.

#### 5. **Dynamic Analysis Score:**
   - **Score:** 10 / 10
   - **Summary:** The code performed well during dynamic analysis, suggesting no issues were detected in runtime behavior.

#### 6. **Formal Verification Score:**
   - **Score:** 0 / 10
   - **Summary:** Since no code was provided for formal verification, the score is zero, and there cannot be a meaningful evaluation.

### Final Evaluation Score Summary
- **Total Score:** 3.282842712474619 / 10
- **Key Strengths:**
  - The code passes all static analysis checks with Clang-Tidy.
  - No memory issues are detected by Valgrind.
  - Dynamic analysis indicates the code runs correctly.
- **Key Weaknesses:**
  - No formal verification was performed.
  - While substantive, the RankMe score indicates room for improvement in code quality.

### Actionable Tips for Improving Code Quality

#### 1. **Formal Verification:**
   - **Action:** Provide Dafny-specific code for formal verification and perform thorough formal verification of your code to catch logical errors.
   - **Example:** Convert the C++ logic into Dafny, ensuring that you capture all the invariants and properties you wish to verify.

#### 2. **Code Quality Improvement (RankMe Score):**
   - **Action:** Review the code based on the metrics that contribute to the RankMe score. This might involve improving code readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.
   - **Example:** If your code includes complex logic or lacks clear comments, consider simplifying the logic and adding comments to enhance readability. For instance, the current code is straightforward but could benefit from comments explaining the purpose of the `main` function, especially if the code grows or changes.

#### 3. **Advanced Static Analysis:**
   - **Action:** Explore additional static analysis tools or configurations to catch potential issues earlier in the development cycle.
   - **Example:** Use tools like cppcheck or include more specific checks in Clang-Tidy, even if it means reviewing more warnings (not just errors).

#### 4. **Enhanced Dynamic Analysis:**
   - **Action:** Add more test cases to ensure that all possible scenarios and edge cases are covered, maximizing the benefit of dynamic analysis.
   - **Example:** If the code logic becomes more complex over time, add unit tests or integration tests to exercise the code under different conditions.

### Summary
The provided C++ code is straightforward with no immediate issues, as confirmed by static and dynamic analysis. However, there is room for improvement, especially formal verification and overall code quality metrics. Implementing the suggested actions can help enhance the robustness and maintainability of the code.
