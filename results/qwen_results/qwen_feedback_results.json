The code provided is already clean and free of errors as indicated by the static analysis, dynamic analysis, and valgrind reports. However, a minor enhancement is made by using `std::endl` instead of just `\"\\n\"` to ensure the output buffer is flushed, which aligns with best practices in some contexts where immediate output is necessary.",
