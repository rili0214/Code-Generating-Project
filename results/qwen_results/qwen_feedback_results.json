These corrections were integrated.\n- **Code Enhancements**:\n  - Added docstrings for the `bubblesort` and `main` functions to improve code readability and maintainability.\n  - Wrapped the main execution in a `main()` function and used the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard to allow for better modularity and testing.\n  - Ensured the original list is not modified by passing a copy of `sort1` to the `bubblesort` function.\n  - Added a final newline as per pylint's suggestion to improve file format compliance.",
