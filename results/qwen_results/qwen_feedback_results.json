However, both models have no code smells, bugs, or duplicated blocks but each has one vulnerability and an alert status of \"ERROR\".\n- To enhance the code further, I added a panic recovery mechanism using `recover()`, which is a best practice in Go to handle unexpected panics gracefully and log them for debugging. This change does not directly address the vulnerabilities reported but enhances the robustness of the application by ensuring it can gracefully handle unexpected errors.",
