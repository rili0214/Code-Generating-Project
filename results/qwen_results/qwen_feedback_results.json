The \"qwen\" model's implementation was chosen because it had better dynamic analysis results (9 vs 10 for \"llama\") and no memory issues as reported by Valgrind, whereas \"llama\" had multiple memory issues. The selected code from \"qwen\" is correct, efficient, and adheres to Java best practices.",
