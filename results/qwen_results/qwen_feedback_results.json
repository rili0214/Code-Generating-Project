However, upon reviewing the analysis results, we notice that \"qwen\" does not have any dynamic or memory issues, unlike \"llama.\" The code from \"qwen\" is slightly better in terms of handling different types within the list and is more robust. Therefore, the enhanced debugged code is based on the \"qwen\" model."
